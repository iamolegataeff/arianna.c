Q: What is Melting point?
A: The melting point of a substance is the temperature at which this substance goes from the solid state to the liquid one, at a normal pressure. For water, this is 0° Celsius (32° Fahrenheit, 273.15 Kelvin). The chemical element with the highest melting point is tungsten. Some chemical compounds have a higher melting point. When looking at when a liquid substance becomes solid, most people call this the freezing point. For most substances, like water, this is the same as the melting point. There are substances, where this is not the case (they melt at one temperature, and freeze at another).

A: In classical mechanics, an impulse is defined as the integral of a force with respect to time: :\mathbf{I} = \int \mathbf{F}\, dt where :I is impulse (sometimes marked J), :F is the force, and : dt shows it is with respect to time. Impulse is also described as the change in momentum. If the force and the mass of the object do not change, impulse can be simply expressed as: :\mathbf{I} = \mathbf{F}\,\Delta t = m \,\Delta \mathbf{v} = \Delta\mathbf{p} where : F is the constant total net force applied, : Δt is the time over which the force is applied, : m is the constant mass of the object, : Δv ...

Q: What is Mutation?

A: Vibration means quickly moving back and forth (or up and down) about a point of equilibrium. The vibration may be periodic (having a pattern) or random. Something that is vibrating may shake at the same time. If it vibrates in a regular way, it may produce a musical note because it can make the air vibrate. This vibration will send sound waves to the ear and to the brain. In structural engineering including earthquake engineering, vibrations may be bad. They may cause the structure to fail. Vehicles and their passengers or cargo may also suffer damage from vibrations.

Q: What is Solution (chemistry)?
A: In chemistry, a solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances. The substances that are dissolved are called solutes. The substance the solutes are dissolved in is called the solvent. An example from everyday experience is a solid like salt or sugar (which are crystalline solids), dissolved in a liquid (like water). Gases can dissolve in liquids. An example is carbon dioxide or oxygen in water. Liquids may dissolve in other liquids and gases in other gases. The amount of solute added to the solvent determines the concentration of the solution.

(However, there are some times when the company will not have to pay the money back, such as if the person was not careful.)

Q: What is Bunsen burner?
A: A Bunsen burner is a common piece of laboratory equipment. It is commonly used for heating chemical substances, sterilization, and combustion. It works by burning flammable gas. It is named after Robert Wilhelm Bunsen, a German chemist. He made important improvements on an earlier burner invented by Michael Faraday. The Bunsen burner can be adjusted to make a flame that is very hot without making much light. This allows seeing the different colors that various chemicals make when they are sprinkled into the flame. equipment

Q: What is Reaction?
A: A reaction might refer to: * Chain reaction * Chemical reaction, happens when one or more chemicals are changed into one or more other chemicals. * Light reaction * Nuclear reaction, a process involving an atomic nucleus or more than one nucleus. * Reaction (physics) -From Newton's third law: "For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction". The idea that any one force has an opposite force.

He was sent to a local school to learn how to read and write. A local vicar paid for this, seeing his obvious intelligence. Faraday became the greatest experimental physicist of the nineteenth century. Faraday became a Fellow of the Royal Society, and was awarded the Royal, Copley and Rumford medals of the Society.

Q: What is Robert Bunsen?
A: Robert Wilhelm Eberhard Bunsen (30 March 1811 – 16 August 1899) was a German chemist. He improved the bunsen burner which now has his name. It was invented by Michael Faraday. Much more important was the work he did which led to spectroscopy. Together with Gustav Kirchhoff, he developed a method of using the spectrum of light to identify the composition of solids,liquids or gases. Spectroscopy originated through the study of visible light dispersed according to its wavelength, for example, by a prism.

Q: What is Möbius strip?
A: designed as a Möbius strip.]] The Möbius strip or Möbius band, is a looped surface with only one side and only one edge. A demonstrative band can be made using a strip of paper by gluing the two ends together with a half-twist. The twisting is possible in two directions; so there are two different (mirror-image) Möbius strips. The Mobius strip is known for its unusual properties. A line being drawn along the center of the loop would go around twice before coming back to its starting point. Cutting along the center line of the loop creates one longer band, not two.

Like the Möbius strip, it only has one surface. Mathematicians call this a non-orientable surface. Klein bottles only exist in four-dimensional space, but a model of a Klein bottle can be made in 3D. This model is different from the original because at some point the shape touches itself. In 3D, part of the shape is "inside" the rest.

Q: What is Entropy?
A: The entropy of an object is a measure of the amount of energy which is unavailable to do work. Entropy is also a measure of the number of possible arrangements the atoms in a system can have. In this sense, entropy is a measure of uncertainty or randomness. The higher the entropy of an object, the more uncertain we are about the states of the atoms making up that object because there are more states to decide from. A law of physics says that it takes work to make the entropy of an object or system smaller; without work, entropy can never become smaller – you could say that everything slowly goes to disorder (higher entropy).

Q: What is Side?

Valleys often start as a downward fold between two upward folds in the surface of the Earth, and sometimes as a rift valley. A valley is made deeper by a stream of water or a river as it flows from the high land to the lower land, and into a lake or sea. Some valleys are made by glaciers which are slow-moving rivers of ice.

Q: What is Manifold?
A: s of a triangle is not equal to 180°. A sphere is not a Euclidean space, but locally the laws of the Euclidean geometry are good approximations. In a small triangle on the face of the earth, the sum of the angles is almost 180°. A sphere can be represented by several two dimensional maps, therefore a sphere is a manifold.]] A manifold is a concept from mathematics. Making a manifold is like making a flat map of a sphere (the Earth). The Earth is a sphere, a three dimensional object of geometry. Yet, maps (two-dimensional representations) can be made of the Earth.

A food chain also represents a series of events and consumption in which food and energy are consumed from one organism in an ecosystem to another.
