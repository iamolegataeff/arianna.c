They were made from electrum, an alloy found in riverbeds. Most people use coins as currency. They usually have lower value than banknotes. Most are made in government mints.
Conceptual metaphor: A conceptual metaphor or cognitive metaphor is a metaphor which refers to one domain (group of ideas) in terms of another. For example, treating quantity in terms of direction: #Prices are rising. #I attacked every weak point in his argument. (Argument as war rather than enquiry or search for truth). #Life is a journey. #Love talked about as if it were war or competition. #Time talked about as if it were a path through space, or a quantity that can be saved or spent or wasted. The idea of a conceptual metaphor came from a book by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson in 1980: Metaphors we live by.
Crust: Crust is a piece of bread where the edge where it is harder and darker. Crust can also mean: *Crust (geology) - the outer solid layer of a planet such as the Earth but other planets also. *On Earth the crust can be divided into: **continental crust on which the land of the planet Earth sits **oceanic crust which forms most of the ocean floor
Comedy: , the muse of comedy, holding a comic mask – detail of “Muses Sarcophagus”, the nine Muses and their attributes; marble, early second century AD, Via Ostiense - Louvre]] , a well-known comedian]] of comedy and tragedy]] Comedy (from ), in modern times, is an entertainment with generally funny content. It is able to make people laugh. This definition was used for theatre plays, and was first used in Ancient Greece. Aristotle defined this as “Comedy is, as we have said, an imitation of characters of a lower type- not, however, in the full sense of the word bad, the ludicrous being merely a subdivision of the ugly.
Comet: ]] A comet is a ball of mostly ice that moves around in outer space. Comets are often described as "dirty snowballs". They are very different from asteroids. The orbital inclinations of comets are usually high and not near the ecliptic where most solar system objects are found. Most of them are long-period comets and come from the Kuiper belt. That is very far away from the Sun, but some of them also come near enough to Earth for us to see at night. They have long "tails", because the Sun melts the ice.
Cytology: Cytology is the study of the cells, especially their appearance and structure. Cells are the small parts that make up all living things, and their effects on each other and their environment. There are two types of cells. Prokaryotic cells do not have a clear and easy-to-see nucleus, and do not have a membrane, or wall, around them. Eukaryotic cells have an easy-to-see nucleus where all of the cell's functions take place, and a membrane around them. The main organelles of a cell and their uses are: * Mitochondria: produces energy for the cell * Endoplasmic reticulum: makes proteins and carbohy...
Cheese: Cheese is a dairy product that is made from milk from many different animals' milk. There are many types of cheese, such as cheddar, Swiss, and provolone. Many things affect the form, texture, color and flavor of a cheese. These include the milk (cow or goat), if the milk has been pasteurized, the amount of butterfat, bacteria and mold in the cheese, how the cheese is made, how much fat is in the cheese, and how old the cheese is.
Constitution: 's stele shows him receiving the laws of Babylon from the seated sun deity.]] The constitution of a country (or a state) is a special type of law document that tells how its government is supposed to work. Every country has its own constitution, it tells how the country's leaders are to be chosen and how long they get to stay in office, how new laws are made and old laws are to be changed or removed based on law, what kind of people are allowed to vote and what other rights they are guaranteed, and how the constitution can be changed.
Circle: A circle is a round, two-dimensional shape. All points on the edge of the circle are at the same distance from the center. The point on the side. Mathematicians use the letter r for the length of a circle's radius. The center of a circle is the point in the very middle. It is often written as O. The diameter (meaning "all the way across") of a circle is a straight line that goes from one side to the opposite and right through the center of the circle. Mathematicians use the letter d for the length of this line.
Capitalization: Capitalization (North American spelling), or capitalisation (British spelling), is a process to make one letter or more uppercase. The first letter of a sentence is capitalised in many languages, as are the first letters of proper nouns such as names of people and places. In German, however, all nouns are capitalized. In the Latin alphabet, which is used in English, these are the uppercase or capital letters or majuscules: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z These are the lowercase or small letters or minuscules: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n...
Cuba: Cuba is an island country in the Caribbean Sea. The country is made up of the big island of Cuba, the Isla de la Juventud island (Isle of Youth), and many smaller islands. Havana is the capital city of Cuba. It is the largest city. The second largest city is Santiago de Cuba. In Spanish, the capital is called "La Habana". Cuba is near the United States, Mexico, Haiti, Jamaica and the Bahamas. People from Cuba are called Cubans (cubanos in Spanish). The official language is Spanish. It is the largest island of the West Indies and the second most populous island (after Hispaniola) of the West Indies.
Cube: A cube is a type of polyhedron with all right angles and whose height, width and depth are all the same. It is a type of rectangular prism, which is itself a type of hexahedron. A cube is one of the simplest mathematical shapes in space. Something that is shaped like a cube can be called cubic. Surface area of cube=6l^2 Lateral Surface area of cube=4l^2 Volume of cube=l^3 cube.]]
Cost of living: Cost of living is the amount of money it costs just to live in a certain place. It is measured using a list of things people need, like food and housing. Governments measure cost of living to give welfare (money or benefits for poor people) and to set minimum wage. When the cost of living is higher than people can pay, a cost of living crisis happens. Causes for a cost of living crisis can be poverty, people making less money due to inflation, increased cost of needed items, and problems with the economy. This crisis can cause health effects right away and in the future. indicators
December: December (Dec.) is the twelfth and last month of the year in the Gregorian calendar, coming between November (of the current year) and January (of the following year). It has 31 days. With the name of the month coming from the Latin decem for "ten", it was the tenth month of the year before January and February were added to the Roman calendar. December always begins on the same day of the week as September, and ends on the same day of the week as April. December's flower is the Narcissus. Its birthstone is the turquoise.
Dublin: Dublin () is the capital city of the Republic of Ireland, and the biggest city on the island of Ireland. In 2022, there were over 2.13 million people living in the Greater Dublin Area. Dublin was built by the Vikings upon the river Liffey. The river divides the city into two parts, North Dublin and South Dublin. Many famous writers lived in Dublin. Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw were born in Dublin. James Joyce is probably Dublin's best known and most international writer. Dublin is home to Ireland's largest stadium for all sports, Croke Park.
Dance: ian dancing girls and musicians]] event]] in 1921]] Dance is a performing art. It is described in many ways. It is when people move to a musical rhythm. They may be alone, or in a group. The dance may be an informal play, a part of a ritual, or a part of a professional performance. There are many kinds of dances, and every human society has its own dances. Dancing is not a sport, though it does have some athletic aspects. Dance is an art. Some people dance to express their feelings and emotions, or to feel better.
Dissolution of the monasteries: 's visitors leaving a monastery. People think this could be Colchester Abbey, after it was ruined.]] The dissolution of the monasteries was an event that happened from 1536 to 1540, when English King Henry VIII took away the land and money that the nuns and monks of the Roman Catholic church owned. Henry VIII then gave this land and money to people that supported him. This was also when Henry VIII made himself the new head of the Church of England (which is a type of Christianity). Parliament made the Act of Supremacy to give him the right to do both these things.
Deadline: A deadline is a time by which some task must be completed. Very often, it means a time limit that is set in place by an authority - for example, a teacher tells students that they must turn in their homework in by a certain time. This is so the teacher is able to report fairly to his or her principal that every student had the same chance to do the work. Deadlines may also be set by a time horizon that comes from something that is not a human authority, but part of nature. For example, by sunset one must do those tasks requiring daylight.
Dutton's Speedwords: Dutton Speedwords is a made-up language written by Reginald John Garfield Dutton. The idea of Dutton Speedwords is to make frequent words short, and very frequent words very short. Dutton Speedwords can be used as a second language for international communications. Dutton Speedwords is also a shorthand writing system – this means you can use it to write quickly. The method was made up by Reginald John Garfield Dutton (1886-1970) in 1922. It was first published in 1935. It was called International Symbolic Script.
Devil: meeting the Devil in an illustration created around 1460]] and a tail]] In some religions and mythology, the Devil (also called the God of Darkness or Dark God) is an evil spirit, deity, demon, or other supernatural being that tries to create problems for people and distance them from God. In some cultures, the Devil is seen as the embodiment of evil. He is often depicted with red skin, horns, and a tail. Some people also use the word "Satan" for the most powerful devil.
Diarrhea: Diarrhea (DIE-uh-REE-uh), also spelled diarrhoea, happens when the body makes more watery feces than normal. Diarrhea can occur in humans as well as most other mammals.
Dimension: , the cube, and the tesseract. The square is a 2-dimensional object, the cube is a 3-dimensional object, and the tesseract is a 4-dimensional object. A 1-dimensional object is just a line. A projection of the cube is given since it is viewed on a two-dimensional screen. The same applies to the tesseract, which additionally can only be shown as a projection even in three-dimensional space.]] Dimensions are the way we see, measure and experience our world, by using up and down, right to left, back to front, hot and cold, how heavy and how long, as well as more advanced concepts from mathematics and physics.
Distance: Distance is how far one thing is from another thing. It is also a measure of the space between two things. It can be measured along any path. Thus, someone who goes around in a circle has traveled a distance, even though his position has not changed. In geometry, the distance between two points A and B is sometimes written as \overline{AB}. Pythagorean theorem is often used in the calculation of distance. Distance is a scalar, and thus is different from displacement. Displacement is a vector that measures distance with a straight line (and in only one path).
Depth: In math, the distance between the nearest end and the farthest end of an object is its depth. For example, the depth of a box can be measured. When the distance between one end of the box and another end of the box is found, the box's depth was measured.
Dictionary: A dictionary is a type of book which explains the meanings of words or, more precisely, lexemes. The words are arranged in alphabetical order so that they can be found quickly. The word "dictionary" comes from the Latin "dictio" ("saying"). There are several types of dictionaries: dictionaries which explain words and how they are used, dictionaries which translate words from one language to another, dictionaries of biography which tell about famous people, technical dictionaries which explain the meanings of technical words or words connected to a particular subject (sometimes called a thesaurus).
Definition: A definition in language explains what a word or phrase means. Defining means giving a definition. Other words with this meaning are description and explanation. They describe what a word means and explains to the person when and where it can be used. In mathematics, a definition is an exact way of saying what a mathematical concept is. It might not be the easiest way to say what it is, but it is used because it is exact. It can be used in a mathematical proof.
Denmark: Denmark (), officially named the Kingdom of Denmark, is a Old Norse, the country was called Danmǫrk, referring to the Danish March (the marches of the Danes). The capital city of Denmark is Copenhagen, on the island of Zealand. Denmark is a constitutional monarchy (meaning the head of state is a monarch who has few established powers) with a King, Frederik X. Denmark is a parliamentary state, meaning the people appoint a parliament to make decisions for them, and it has a democratic government headed by an elected Prime Minister, who currently is Mette Frederiksen since 2019.
Death: is often used as a symbol for death]] Death is the end of a life in an organism. All biological and living activity of the living thing stops, including the mind and the senses. The usual signal for death in humans and many other animals is that the heart stops beating and cannot be restarted. This can be caused by many things. All living things have a limited lifespan, and all living things eventually die. Living things that have died are normally described as being dead. Death of humans is often investigated for the cause, in case of crime (such as murder), accident or disease that may continue to kill other humans.
Diesel-electric: A diesel-electric engine is a diesel generator, a diesel engine that drives an electric generator. The generator feeds electric power to an electric motor which turns a driveshaft. Its efficiency is higher than when an engine drives a shaft through gears. Most locomotives and many ships use diesel-electric drive. Many diesel-electric drives, especially small ones, store the electricity in a battery. Some designs also store braking energy in a flywheel, which can also charge a battery. However, these add even more complexity and weight to the vehicle, so are more appropriate for city driving where service stations are always available and there is much stop and go driving.
Embassy: embassy in Riga]] A foreign embassy is the official office of one country in another. It is usually in the capital city of the other country. It is where the ambassador and other representatives of the home country work. Much of the diplomacy (talk) between the two governments happens there. They represent their country to the host government. The embassy represents the interests of the entire country and is fully responsible for the relationship between the two countries. The head of the embassy is usually an ambassador, but can also be a minister, high commissioner, or other level of diplomatic personnel appointed by the sending country to represent it.
Europe: of Europe]] .]] Europe is the western part of the continent of Eurasia, often thought of as its own continent. It is separated from Asia by the Ural Mountains in Russia and the Bosporus strait in Turkey. Europe is bordered by water on three sides. On the west is the Atlantic Ocean. To the north is the Arctic Ocean. The Mediterranean Sea separates Southeastern Europe from the continent of Africa. On the eastern border of Europe are the Ural River and Ural Mountains. There are at least 44 or 50 countries in Europe (the European identities of 7 countries: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Russia and Turkey are disputed).
Encyclopedia: An encyclopedia is a collection, usually a book or website, of information. Some are known as encyclopedic dictionaries.An encyclopedia contains a lot of information.
Earth science: eruption is the release of stored energy from below the surface of Earth. The heat comes mostly from radioactive decay, and convection, in the Earth's core and mantle.]] Earth science is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet Earth. Earth science may also be called geoscience. Geoscience is the study of the architecture of the Earth. It is a broader term than geology because it includes aspects of planetary science, which is part of astronomy. The Earth sciences include the study of the atmosphere, oceans and biosphere, as well as the solid earth.
Earth: Infobox planet |24px|🜨]] and |g0]]) Source: Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only place we know of where life exists. One big reason life can exist here is that Earth is an “ocean world.” This means it has a lot of water on its surface, and it is the only planet in our Solar System with liquid water that life can use. Most of Earth’s water is in the oceans, which cover about 71% of the planet’s surface. The rest, about 29%, is land. Most of this land is grouped into large continents, like North America, Africa, and Asia, which are mostly humid and covered with plants.
Et cetera: Et cetera means "and the rest" in Latin. It is typically used in English to continue a list longer than what can be written. The word et cetera is often written as etc.. It is also rarely written as &c, or &. It is the same as et ‒ formed by the joining of "e" and "t" into a single letter.
Experiment: An experiment is a test of an idea or a method. It is often used by scientists and engineers. An experiment is used to see how well the idea matches the real world. Experiments have been used for many years to help people understand the world around them. Experiments are part of scientific method. Many experiments are controlled experiments or even blind experiments. Many are done in a laboratory. But thought experiments are done in mind. Experiments can tell us if a theory is false, or if something does not work.
Ethics: Ethics is the study of good and bad behavior. It is one of the main parts of philosophy. Ethics tries to answer questions like: * What actions are good? What actions are evil? * How can we tell the difference? * Are good and evil the same? * How should we make hard decisions that might help or hurt other people? * How do our actions affect others?
E Prime: E Prime (it means English Prime) defines a way of speaking English without using the verb "to be" in any way ("be, is, am, are, was, were, been, and being"). Instead, an E Prime speaker or writer uses different verbs like "to become," "to remain," and "to equal" or they might choose to rearrange the sentence to show that the "thing" does not actually "act". For example, in E Prime, a writer would change the statement "Mistakes were made" to "Joe made mistakes." This change in wording reveals an actor (Joe) where the previous form concealed the actor.
Einstein on the Beach: Einstein on the Beach is an opera written by the minimalist composer Philip Glass and theater director and designer Robert Wilson. It was first acted for an audience in Avignon, France in 1976. It is a single act opera, about five hours long with no intermission. Because of the length and the minimalist ([[repetition
English: English can mean: * From or about the country England * English people * English language * The Amish word for somebody who is not in their group * Avoirdupois, a system of measurement sometimes called "English". * English opening, a chess opening * English, Indiana, the county seat of Crawford County
Ethnic group: An ethnic group is a group of people who are considered to be the same in some or multiple ways. They may all have the same ancestors, speak the same language, or have the same culture, which could sometimes include religion. They often live in the same or surrounding area. Sometimes almost all of the people in one country are of the same ethnic group, but not always. Often one country may have several different ethnic groups, or the people of one ethnic group may live in several different countries.
Ebola virus: Ebola virus or Ebola virus disease (EVD), often shortened to Ebola, is a very dangerous virus. It belongs to the family Filoviridae. Four different types of Ebola virus can cause a severe disease which is often fatal. Ebola infection causes hemorrhagic fever which starts suddenly. "Hemorrhagic" means that the victim will bleed a lot, inside and outside of their body. The virus attacks almost every organ and tissue of the human body, causing multiple organs to fail at once. Out of every 100 people who get Ebola, on average 25 to 90 die.
Ecology: Ecology is the branch or aspect of biology that studies the biota (living things), the environment, and their interactions. It comes from the Greek language Ecology is the study of [[ecosystems. Ecosystems describe the web or network of relations among organisms at different scales of organization. Since ecology refers to any form of biodiversity, ecologists research everything from tiny bacteria in nutrient recycling to the effects of tropical rain forests on the Earth's atmosphere. Scientists who study these interactions are called ecologists.
Economics: . 's stock exchange. Buyers and sellers are not present themselves. They use intermediaries and technology to trade. Most ideas about buying and selling are the same as in a "real" market though.]] in New York City, USA]] Economics is the social science which studies economic activity: how people make choices to get what they want. It has been defined as "the study of scarcity and choice" and is basically about the choices people make. It also studies what affects the production, distribution and consumption of goods and services in an economy.
Chemical element: has a crystalline structure]] is one of only two elements that are liquid at 25°C. The other is Mercury (element) A chemical element is a [[substance that is made up of only one Chemical species The number of protons in an atom is called the [[atomic number. For example, all atoms with 6 protons are atoms of the chemical element carbon, and all atoms with 92 protons are atoms of the element uranium. The number of neutrons in the nucleus does not have to be the same in every atom of an element. Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes.
Egypt: Egypt, officially the Arab Republic of Egypt is a country in the Middle East and the Eastern Mediterranean, located in North Africa and Western Asia. It is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, the Southern Levant compromising the Gaza Strip of Palestine and Israel to the northeast, the Red Sea to the east, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west; the Gulf of Aqaba in the northeast separates Egypt from Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Cairo is the capital, largest city, and leading cultural center, while Alexandria is the second-largest city and an important hub of industry and tourism.
Everything2: Everything2 or E2 is a website. It lets people make pages about many different things, and some people use it as a diary. E2 users create pages called nodes and add stuff in writeups. Only logged-in users can create writeups. Only the person who created the writeup or someone who the website owners (called "gods") choose can edit the writeup. On the other hand, on Wikipedia, anyone can edit pages, but on Everything2 only those who can edit the writeup can edit pages. Everything2 does not require a neutral point of view like Wikipedia does.
Editor: An Editor is a person who makes edits (changes) to documents. More specifically the word editor can mean: * a person who changes texts; see copy editing. ** a newspaper or magazine editor is a person who prepares articles for printing and sometimes chooses which articles to put in the newspaper. The main editor of a newspaper or magazine is called the "editor-in chief". * a Wikipedia user who makes changes (also called "edits") to pages (articles, templates, categories, etc) * text editor, an application program for editing an electronic text or media document * one who, or that which, edits p...
Ecological yield: Ecological yield is the harvestable growth of an ecosystem. It is most commonly measured in forestry - in fact sustainable forestry is defined as that which does not harvest more wood in a year than has grown in that year, within a given patch of forest. However, the concept is also applicable to water, and soil, and any other aspect of an ecosystem which can be both harvested and renewed - the so-called renewable resources. The carrying capacity of an ecosystem is reduced over time if more than the amount which is "renewed" (refreshed or regrown or rebuilt).
Experience economy: The experience economy is the intangible service economy that customers experience directly. In moral purchasing, Natural Capitalism and other theories of how consumers make choices, they are actually choosing experiences or comprehensive outcomes of their choices. For instance to buy local is to choose a whole experience of local suppliers, such as in a farmers market or Slow Food, that is quite different than the experience associated with factory food or fast food.
Execution: Execution is where state authorities kill someone for having committed an extremely serious crime, usually treason or especially terrible murders. In most countries where the death penalty is still provided for by law, using it is an option available to the sentencing judge: even if the jury or judicial panel recommends the death penalty, the presiding judge still has the option to lock the convicted person in a prison for the rest of their life. A person whose job is to execute others is an executioner.
February: February (Feb.) is the second month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars, coming between January and March. It has 28 days in common years, and 29 days in leap years. This was to make the calendar match to the rest of the world. In 1930 and 1931, February had 30 days in the Soviet Union because the government changed all the months to be 30 days long. The name comes either from the Roman god Februus or else from "februa", the festivals of purification celebrated in Rome every fifteenth of this month.
FAQ: FAQ is an abbreviation for "Frequently Asked Question(s)". The term is used for a list of questions and answers. All of the questions are supposed to be asked often and they all are about the same thing. Since the acronym was first used in written form, there are different ways it is said; both "fak" and "F.A.Q." are commonly used.
Flame (disambiguation): A flame is the part of a fire that can be seen. Flame might also mean: * Flaming (internet) - Insult sent over the internet on purpose * Flame polishing * Flame retardant, a kind of material that resists heat and flame. * Flame Nebula, a star in Orion's Belt
Financial capital: Financial capital is a form of capital. It is things that have value, but do not do anything by themselves. They are only valuable because people value (want) them. For example, money is a form of financial capital. You cannot do anything with money but it still has value. Financial capital is used to pay for things, this is because there is always more of it and people always want it. This means that financial capital has a stable value and can be traded in most places and with most people. Some forms of financial capital, such as stocks, gold or bonds are not wanted by everybody.
Fecund universes: Fecund universes is a multiverse theory of Lee Smolin. It relies on models of our universe and statistics from astrophysics but is more correctly a theory of cosmology. In this theory, collapsing stars, or black holes, are always creating new universes with slightly different laws of physics. Because these laws are only slightly different, each is assumed to be like a mutation of the original universe, as if each universe was a kind of single-celled organism. It would reproduce by "splitting" in some sense.
Food: .]] Food is what people, plants and animals eat to live. Every organism needs energy to carry on with the process of living which comes from food. Food usually comes from animals and plants. It is eaten by living things to provide energy and nutrition. Food contains the nutrition that people and animals need to be healthy. The consumption of food is normally enjoyable to humans. It contains protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, water and minerals. Liquids used for energy and nutrition are often called "drinks".
Fine: If someone is found guilty of a crime, their punishment may be to pay a fine, a certain amount of money. In many countries, fines can be ordered by police, court judges and some government officers. When agreeing to a contract with a business, a customer may agree to certain rules. If the customer breaks the rules, then they agree to pay a fine for doing so. For example, when somebody hires a car and agrees to return it by Friday, they agree that if they do not return the car by Friday, they must pay a $50 fine to the business.
Frying: Frying is cooking food in hot butter or vegetable oil or other fat. We can fry food in a small amount of fat in a pan or in a lot of oil in a pot. Some restaurants use deep frying to fry a large amount of food. methods
Fish: ]] ]] . They are camouflaged as floating seaweed.]] Fish (plural: fish or fishes) are a group of animals which live in water and respire (get oxygen) from their gills. As a group, they are much older than other vertebrates. The first fish developed about 500 million years ago. Shell fish such as the crab or lobster are actually small, boneless creatures that live in their own shell house or shell-like partial exterior, dwelling in seas and oceans. Some other examples include :Jawless fish :Armoured fish :Cartilaginous fish :Ray-finned fish :Lobe-finned fish.
Foot (human): :Foot is also the name of a unit of measurement. See foot (unit). A foot (one foot, two or more feet) is a body part on the end of a leg. It is used when walking. It is also important for balance: it helps people stand straight. People also use it to kick, in both fighting and sports, football being an example. People's hands and feet have the same shape: they both have five digits (the fingers and toes). Many other animals with backbones also have five digits. The part of the foot which joins it to the leg is called the heel.
France: France ( or ; ), officially the French Republic (, ), is a country in Western Europe. It also includes various departments and territories of France overseas. Mainland France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. It is sometimes referred to as L’Hexagone ("The Hexagon") because of the shape of its territory. France is a unitary semi-presidential republic. The head of state is the President, who is also a politician. The Prime Minister is secondary to the President.
Finland: Finland (Finnish: Suomi) is a country in Northern Europe and is a member state of the European Union. Finland is one of the Nordic countries and is also part of Fennoscandia. Finland is located between the 60th and 70th latitudes North. Its neighbours are Sweden to the west, Norway to the north, Russia to the east and Estonia to the south, beyond the sea called Gulf of Finland. Most of the western and southern coast is on the shore of the Baltic Sea. The capital of Finland is Helsinki; the second largest city is Tampere.
Fruit: In botany, a fruit is a plant structure that contains the plant's seeds. To a botanist, the word fruit is used only if it comes from the part of the flower which was an ovary. It is an extra layer round the seeds, which may or may not be fleshy. However, even in the field of botany, there is no general agreement on how fruits should be classified. Many do have extra layers from other parts of the flower. ]] In general speech, and especially in cooking, some fruits are a sweet product, but not all fruits are sweet, most fruits are fruity and edible, and many botanical fruits are known as vegetables.
Farm: , Malaysia.]] A farm is a piece of land used to grow crops and/or raise animals. People who grow these plants or raise these animals are called farmers. This work is called farming. Land that is used to grow plants is called farmland. Land that is used to feed animals with its grass is called pasture. Land that can be used to grow plants for food is called arable land. Many farms are very large and can cause damage. In some places farms are many and small, and can also cause damage. Farms provides most of the food for people.
Geography: with country borders and big cities shown]] Geography (from Greek: , geographia, literally "earth description") is the study of earth and its people and one of social sciences. Its features are things like continents, seas, rivers and mountains. Its inhabitants are all the people and animals that live on it. Its phenomena are the things that happen like tides, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes and more. A person who is an expert in geography is a geographer. A geographer tries to understand the world and the things that are in it, how they started and how they have changed.
Grammar: Grammar is the study of words, how they are used in sentences, and how they change in different situations. The Ancient Greeks used to call it grammatikē tékhnē, the craft of letters. It can have any of these meanings: # The study of a language: how it works, and everything about it. This is background research on language. # The study of sentence structure. Rules and examples show how the language should be used. This is a correct usage grammar, as in a textbook or manual/guide. # The system which people learn as they grow up.

We can use like for "the same as" or "nearly the same as": ::This cheese sandwich feels like rubber = the sandwich is difficult to eat, nearly the same as rubber. ::Jenny is like her mother = Jenny has brown hair, and her mother also has brown hair (for example). ::Your pen is like my pen = Your pen and my pen are the same sort.
Political divisions of China: There are twenty-three provinces, four municipalities, five autonomous regions and two special administrative regions in the People's Republic of China. Provinces are pronounced Shěng in Chinese Pinyin. Provinces and autonomous regions are subdivided into prefectures and sub-provincial cities. The island of Taiwan is claimed as a province by the People's Republic of China (PRC), but is not under their control. Taiwan is an island known as Republic of China (Taiwan).
List of fruits: Fruits on this list are defined as the word is used in everyday speech. It does not include vegetables, whatever their origin. The following items are fruits according to the scientific definition, but are sometimes considered to be vegetables:
Legislature: is a legislature of 27 countries]] Legislature is a word that comes from the Latin language, meaning "those who write the laws." A legislature is therefore a group of people who introduce, debate and vote for and on new laws, for example in a state or country. Each person in the legislature is usually either elected or appointed. The constitution of that state or country usually tells how a legislature is supposed to work. In many countries, the legislature is called a Parliament, Congress, or National Assembly.
Linear algebra: Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics. It came from mathematicians trying to solve systems of linear equations. Vectors and matrices are used to solve these systems. The main objects of study currently are vector spaces and linear mappings between vector spaces. Linear algebra is useful in other branches of mathematics (e.g. differential equations and analytic geometry). It can also be applied to the real world in areas such as engineering, physics and economics. Linear algebra describes ways to solve and manipulate (rearrange) systems of linear equations.
London: London is the capital and largest city of both England and the United Kingdom. It is also the city with the highest population in the UK. The population is just under 9 million. The city is the largest in western Europe by population and area. On the Thames, London has been a central city since it was founded by the Romans two millennia ago as Londinium. The Romans bridged the river Thames and built a road network to connect Londinium with the rest of the country. London's original city centre, the City of London is England's smallest city.
Litre: The litre (international spelling) or liter (American spelling) (symbol: l or L) is one of the metric units of volume. It is not a basic SI unit, but it is a supplementary unit. One litre is the volume of 1000 cubic centimetres, that is a cube of 10 × 10 × 10 centimetres (1000&nbsp;cm3). One litre of water at has the mass of exactly one kilogram. This results from the definition given in 1795, where the gram was defined as the weight of one cubic centimetre of melting ice. Liters are usually utilized to measure the volume of liquids, this is because the density of liquids can vary a lot.
Lime: Lime is a green fruit, and the tree fruit itself. They are citrus fruits similar to lemons. Citrus fruits like limes are rich in vitamin C. Sailors from Britain were given lemon or lime juice to stop them falling ill with scurvy. This is how they got the nickname Limey. There are several citrus trees whose fruits are called limes. They include the key lime Citrus aurantiifolia, the Persian lime, the kaffir lime, and the desert lime Citrus glauca. Limes are small, round and bright green. If they stay on the tree for a long time they turn yellow.
Mathematics: mathematician Euclid (holding calipers), 3rd century BC, as imagined by Raphael in this detail from the School of Athens (1509–1511)]] Mathematics is the study of numbers, shapes, and patterns. The word comes from the Greek μάθημα (máthema), meaning "science, knowledge, or learning", and is sometimes shortened to math or maths. It is the study of: * Numbers: including how things can be counted. * Structure: including how things are organized, but also how they can be or could have been. This subfield is usually called algebra.
March: March (Mar.) is the third month of the year in the Gregorian calendar, coming between February and April. It has 31 days. March is named after Mars, the Roman god of war.

May: May is the fifth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars, coming between April and June. It has 31 days. The month of May might have been named for the Roman goddess Maia, or more likely the Roman goddess of fertility Bona Dea, whose festival was held in May. May never begins or ends on the same day of the week as any other month. May's flower is the Lily of the Valley. Its birthstone is the emerald. The meaning of the emerald is success in love.
Music: n Symphony Orchestra in Stockholm, 2008]] gypsy flamenco guitarist]] Music is a form of art that uses sound organised in time. Music is also a form of entertainment that puts sounds together in a way that people like, find interesting or dance to. Most music includes people singing with their voices or playing musical instruments, such as the piano, guitar, drums or bass.
Madrid: Madrid (pronounced: “mah-drid or /məˈdrɪd/) is the capital and largest city of Spain. Madrid is in the middle of Spain, in the Community of Madrid. The Community is a large area that includes the city as well as small towns and villages outside the city. 7 million people live in the Community. More than 3 million live in the city itself. It is the largest city of Spain and, at 655 m (2,100&nbsp;ft) above sea level, the second highest capital in Europe (after the Andorran capital Andorra la Vella).
Montreal: Montreal (, spelled Montréal in French) is a city in the country of Canada. It is the largest city in the province of Quebec and the second-largest city in Canada. Most of the people who live in Montreal speak French. Montreal is built on an island sitting in the Saint Lawrence River. More than three million people live in the Greater Montreal metropolitan area. At the centre of Montreal is a mountain called Mount Royal. The suburb of Westmount is a very rich suburb on the island of Montreal.
Macadamia nut: The macadamia nut is the fruit of a tree that first came from the east coast of Australia. There is more than one kind of Macadamia tree. Only two kinds are grown for food. The tree is an evergreen (stays green all year long). It grows up to high. It has groups of small white flowers. It grows best in subtropical (wet and always warm) climates. It needs well-drained soil (water can flow away easily) and of rain a year. The nutmeat (the soft part inside the shell that can be eaten) is mostly a creamy white color.
Maui: Maui is the second largest of the Hawaiian Islands, in the United States. It has a population of just over 150,000 and is 727 square miles (1883&nbsp;km²) in size. Maui is part of Maui County, Hawaii. The larger (or better known) towns include Kahului, Wailuku, Lahaina, Hana, and Wailea. Main industries are agriculture and tourism. Maui was named for the demi-god Maui. In Hawaiian legend, he raised all the islands from the sea. Maui is also known as the "Valley Isle" for the large fertile isthmus (narrow land connection) between two volcanoes.
Moloka'i: view of the East side of Molokai, Hawaii]] Molokaʻi (sometimes mistakenly called Molokai) is the fifth largest island in the U.S. Hawaiian Islands. The island is 38 miles long and 10 miles across. Its land area is 261 square miles. The highest mountain is named Kamakou, and it is 4,970 feet (1,514 meters) high.

It is one of the least developed of the Hawaiian islands.
Money: coins and bank notes]] caricature, the plentiful money bags handed to King George III are contrasted with the beggar whose legs and arms were amputated, in the left corner|250px]]Money, also sometimes called currency, can be defined as anything that people use to buy goods and services. Money is what many people receive for selling their own things or services. There are lots of different kinds of money in the world. Most countries have their own kind of money, such as the United States dollar or the Iranian rial.
Multiplication: Multiplication is an arithmetic operation for finding the product of two numbers in mathematics, and is the opposite of division. It is often represented by symbols such as \times or \cdot. Multiplication is the third operation in math, after addition which is the first, and subtraction which is the second. It can also be defined on number mathematical objects as well. With natural numbers, multiplication gives the number of tiles in a rectangle, where one of the two numbers equals the number of tiles on one side, and the other number equals the number of tiles on the other side.
Microsoft: Microsoft Corporation is an Edge, MSN and Xbox, among others. Most Microsoft programs cannot be downloaded for free–people have to buy them in a shop or online. Some products (like the Windows operating system) are often already installed when people buy a new computer.
Islamic world: The Islamic world or Muslim world consists of all people who believe in Islam. It is not an exact location, but rather a community. When they do things together as Muslims, they are the "umma", which means "community" referring to all of the believers. The faith emphasizes unity and defense of fellow Muslims, so it is common for these nations to cooperate. Recent conflicts in the Muslim world have sometimes spread because of this desire to cooperate (see below). It is also likely that some have been made shorter and less damaging because of it. Some might even have never started.
Multiverse: A multiverse is the theory of a conjectured set of multiple possible universes, including ours, which make up reality. These universes are sometimes called parallel universes. A number of different versions have been considered. The word "multiverse" was created in 1895 by psychologist William James as a philosophical concept.
MediaWiki: MediaWiki is the name of the software that runs all of the Wikimedia projects and many more. MediaWiki was released in 2002. It is a free server-based software which is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This means it is free content, or open source. MediaWiki is designed to be run on a large web server farm for a website that gets millions of hits per day. MediaWiki is a very powerful, scalable software and a feature-rich wiki implementation. It uses PHP to process and display data stored in its MySQL database.
First language: ) language in Nakhchivan, Azerbaijan]] A first language (also mother language, mother tongue, native language, arterial language, or L1) often means the language that a person learns first. It helps one understand words and concepts in the style of that language. Sometimes, but not often, first language means the language that a person speaks best (the second language is then spoken less well than the first language, etc.). In that sense, a person could have more than one first or second language.
Mustache: The hair that grows on the upper lip of some men is called a mustache. The hair that grows on the sides of the face and the chin of some men is called a beard. Some men have a lot of hair and a big mustache, and some have very little. In the modern world, many men shave part or all of their mustaches, or cut their mustache so it does not get very long. A chin beard with no mustache is called a goatee, whilst a chin beard with a mustache is known as a Van Dyke. The earliest facial hair above the lip, as a style, is credited to the Iron Age Celts.
Mile: The mile (symbol: mi) is a unit of length. There are many different kinds of mile but mile on its own usually means the statute mile.
Margarine: Margarine is an artificial butter. It can be made from vegetable oil, or animal fat. It may also contain skimmed milk, salt and emulsifiers. Margarine is used in many baked products. It contains less fat than butter, so is often chosen instead of it. There are also "low fat" margarines, which contain even less fat. However, many types of margarine are made with hydrogenated oils. Products with hydrogenated oil have trans fats, which are unhealthy and can cause heart disease. Other fats, like olive oil, and butter, are a better choice for cooking.
Milky Way: The Milky Way is our home galaxy. It contains around 400 billion stars, including our Sun. The Milky Way has a diameter of as measured using the D25isophote, and is a barred spiral galaxy. The idea that the Milky Way is made of stars goes back to the Ancient Greek philosopher Democritus. Although the word "disk" suggests it is flat, the Milky Way is actually not quite flat. It is slightly warped and twisted. This galaxy belongs to the Local Group of three large galaxies and over 50 smaller galaxies.
Movement: moving through the air]] Movement, or motion, is the state of changing something's position or changing where something is. A bird that is flying is moving. So is a person who is walking. This is, because they change where they are. They "move" from one place to another. There are many forms of science and mathematics that are related to movement. Because of the work of scientists including Galilei and Newton, we know that position is relative. This means that an object's position depends on where it exists in relation to other objects.
Metaphor: Metaphor is a term for a figure of speech. It does not use a word in its basic literal sense. Instead, it uses a word in a kind of comparison. We run, and we also say rivers run. We may run into trouble, especially if we run up a bill at the bar. So a metaphor uses words to make a picture in our mind. It takes a word from its original context, and uses it in another. :"I beat him with a stick" = literal meaning of 'beat'. :"I beat him in an argument" = metaphorical meaning of 'beat'. Metaphors are an essential part of language: it is not possible to speak or write without them.
Metabolism: (ATP), a central intermediate in energy metabolism]] Metabolism is the chemical reactions which keep us alive. It happens in the cells of living organisms. The chemical reactions are catalyzed by enzymes. Metabolism allows organisms to grow, reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments. The word ‘metabolism’ can also refer to digestion and the transport of substances into and between different cells. Metabolism is usually divided into two categories: * Catabolism breaks down organic matter and harvests energy by way of cellular respiration.
Microscope: ]] A microscope is a scientific instrument. It makes small objects look larger. This lets people see the small things. People who use microscopes frequently in their jobs include doctors and scientists. Students in science classes such as biology also use microscopes to study small things. The earliest microscopes had only one lens and are called simple microscopes. Compound microscopes have at least two lenses. In a compound microscope, the lens closer to the eye is called the eyepiece. The lens at the other end is called the objective.
Mass: The mass of an object is a measure of how much of it there is. For example, A mountain has more mass than a rock. Mass is different from weight. Weight is the product of mass times gravitational acceleration. You can measure the mass of an object by using a force on it. The more mass it has, the less it will change how fast it moves. This is called inertial mass because it measures the inertia. An object with a lot of mass, like a planet attracts objects with less mass and keeps them from floating away from the planet.
Mercury (planet): Mercury is the first planet from the Sun. It is the second hottest planet, and the smallest in the Solar System. It is also the closest planet to the Sun. It makes one orbit Mercury is bright when we can see it from [[Earth. It has an apparent magnitude ranging from −2.0 to 5.5. It cannot be seen easily because it is usually too close to the Sun. Because of this, Mercury can only be seen in the morning or evening twilight or when there is a solar eclipse. Less is known about Mercury than about other planets of our Solar System.
Mars: Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, nicknamed The Red Planet. Mars is a terrestrial planet with mythological Roman god of war because it appears of red color. Anything that has to do with Mars is called "Martian". Space probes, such as the Viking program landers, are the main tools for the exploration of Mars.
Classic Mac OS: Mac OS is an operating system for Macintosh computers. Mac OS was first made by Apple Inc. in 1984. In those days Mac OS was called Macintosh System Software – which was shortened to System or SSW (System Software). The term "Mac OS" first appeared in the splash screen for System 7.5.1, but was not adopted as the new name until the release of Mac OS 7.6.
Apple Macintosh: . Unlike most computers, it has a computer system with the screen inside it.]] The Apple Macintosh or just Mac is a line of personal computers made by the American company Apple Inc. The Macintosh was one of the first computers in which the people could use a mouse for pointing on a screen which had icons. This new way of working with a computer (interface) was known as graphical user interface. It was this feature of the Macintosh that made it so popular.
Metre: The metre (British spelling) or meter (American spelling) (symbol: m) is the basic imperial system of measurement, one yard is 0.9144 metres (after international agreement in 1959), so a metre is very near to 39.37 inches: about 3.281 feet, or 1.0936 yards. and iridium) that defined the length of a metre until 1960.]]
Magnifying glass: ]] A magnifying glass is a lens through which can be used to make things appear bigger, so you can see them better. It is used in many applications and manual operations, e.g., for examining postage stamps in philately. The magnifying glass consists of a piece of convex-shaped glass or plastic. It has to be held at the right distance between the eye and the object for the object to be in focus. The magnifying glass usually comes with a handle. A telescope is a more advanced kind of magnifying glass and consists of at least two glass lenses.
Molecule: molecule. Carbon atoms are made blue, oxygen atoms are made red and hydrogen atoms are made white to show the difference. In reality atoms do not have a color.]] A molecule is the smallest amount of a chemical substance that can exist. If a molecule were split into smaller pieces, it would be a different substance. Molecules are made up of atoms that are stuck together in a particular shape or form. Not all combinations of atoms are equally possible; atoms make certain shapes in preference to others.
Moral reasoning: Moral reasoning is a topic studied in psychology and in moral philosophy. It studies how people think about moral issues, problems, and questions. Psychologists who have studied it include Lawrence Kohlberg and Elliot Turiel. Kohlberg said that moral understanding develops in three main stages as a person gets older, but Turiel said that there are three domains of moral understanding that develop at the same time as a person gets older. Moral philosophy, or ethics, is a major branch of philosophy.
Mosque: in Istanbul, Turkey.]] A mosque is a place where Muslims worship. The word mosque comes from the Arabic word masjid. A larger, 'collective', mosque is called a masjid jāmi. Larger mosques offer more services to their community. For many Muslim people, a mosque is more than a place of worship. Muslims worship, study and discuss Islam, and do many other things in a mosque and its compounds. In the United Kingdom, many mosques are used as community centres. They are also used to teach about Islam. Religious festivals and gatherings are held in mosques.
Mammal: Mammals are in the class Mammalia. They are a group of vertebrate animals. They have fur or hair and very precise temperature regulation. With the exception of the monotremes, all mammals bear live young. Unlike other vertebrates, they are the only animals that produce milk for their young through their mammary glands. Parental care of the young is universal among mammals, sometimes for long periods. Mammals became the dominant land animals after non-bird dinosaurs were eliminated. Recent work helped to explain their success: epigenetics seems to have started in early mammals.
Number: A number is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label: * People use symbols to represent numbers; they call them numerals. Common places where numerals are used are for labeling, as in telephone numbers, for ordering, as in serial numbers, or to put a unique identifier, as in an ISBN, a unique number that can identify a book. * Cardinal number * Ordinal number Numbers are also used for other things like counting. Numbers are used when things are measured. Numbers are used to study how the world works.
November: November (Nov.) is the eleventh month of the year in the Gregorian calendar, coming between October and December. It has 30 days. Its name is from the Latin word novem, which means "nine". It was the ninth month of the year before January and February were added to the Roman Calendar. November always begins on the same day of the week as March, and additionally, February in common years. November always ends on the same day of the week as August.
National anthem: A national anthem is a country's official national song that the people use to remember and respect their country. By the 18th century most countries had a national anthem and new countries chose a national anthem when they became independent. Some monarchies have a royal anthem for their monarch.
Name: A name is a word (or a set of words) given to things and people. For example, cat is the name of a kind of animal. "Aarav" , "Adhrit" are names of a person, usually a male. "Ananya" is a common female name. The word 'name' can also be used as a verb. To name something is to give it a name.
Niihau: Niihau (or Niʻihau) is the smallest of the inhabited islands of Hawaii, in the United States. It has a land area of 70 sq. miles (184 km2). It is the oldest of the eight main islands.
Nēnē: The Nēnē, or Hawaiian goose (Branta sandvicensis) is a species of goose. It is found today on only three Hawaiian islands. It gets its name from its soft call. This is an unmistakable species, with its generally brown plumage (feathers) and darker head. Its strong toes have much reduced webbing (skin between the toes), an adjustment to the lava flows on which it breeds.

Fishing net: ]] A fishing net is a woven trap usually used to catch fish. They are usually made out of rope. A net is a kind of tool. Fishing nets are one of the oldest ways of catching fish. They can be made with all kinds of fabric like nylon, cotton, grass, flax, and tree fibers. The oldest known fish nets dates back to 8500 BC in Finland. Native Americans made their nets on the Columbia River from grass, cedar, and spruce root fibers.
Internet slang: Internet slang is slang words which are used on the internet. Most of these words are new, such as Wiki and blog, which were not used before the internet became popular. Some old words were given new meanings, such as mail (which now means email). This makes many metaphors on the Internet, such as boot (which otherwise mean a shoe) and link (which otherwise means a joint in a metal chain). Some existing acronyms, such as "AFK" (To mean "Away from keyboard") and "IRL" (To mean "In real life") were used on bulletin board systems before the internet became popular.

Nature: at Arthur's Pass National Park in South Island, New Zealand|270x270px]] strikes during the eruption of the Galunggung volcano, West Java, in 1982.]] The words nature and natural are used for all the things that are normally not made by humans. The word comes from the Latin natura meaning "birth". Nature includes many things like weather, organisms, landforms, celestial bodies. Scientists study the way the parts of nature work. Things that have been made by people are said to be man-made or called artifacts.
Natural resource: in Belgium]] A natural resource is what people can use from the natural environment. Examples of natural resources are air, water, wood, oil, wind energy, natural gas, iron, mineral and coal. The dividing line between natural resources and man-made resources is not clear-cut. Hydro-electric energy is not a natural resource because people use turbines and generators to convert the energy of moving water to electric current. Petroleum and ores are natural, but need to be changed in some way to make them into usable refined oil and metals.
Negentropy: Negentropy is reverse entropy. It means things becoming more in order. Here 'order' means organisation, structure and function: the opposite of randomness or chaos. One example of negentropy is a star system such as the Solar System. Another example is life. As a general rule, everything in the universe tends towards entropy. Star systems eventually become dead. All energy has gone, and everything in the system is at the temperature of the surrounding space. The opposite of entropy is negentropy.
North America: North America is a large continent in the Northern and Western Hemispheres of Earth. It is to the east of the Pacific Ocean, the west of the Atlantic Ocean, the south of the Arctic Ocean, and it is the northern part of the Americas. The southernmost part is Central America.

North America has three subregions which are the Caribbean, Central America, and North America.
Neptune: Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in the Solar System. It is an ice giant. It is the fourth-largest planet in the system. Neptune's mass is 17 times Earth's mass and a little bit more than Uranus' mass. Neptune is denser and smaller than Uranus. Because of its greater mass, Neptune's gravity makes its atmosphere smaller and denser. It was named after the Roman god of the sea, Neptune. Neptune's astronomical symbol is ♆, the trident of the god Neptune. Neptune's atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium.
Negative: Negative may mean: *Something negative can be something bad. *A negative number is a number that is less than zero. 5 - 8 = -3. *Some people also use negative the same way as "no", or other related words. "Not", "Never", "Nowhere" etc. are all negative words. On two-way radios the word "negative" is used instead of "no" to be clearer. *In film photography, a film negative is an exposed picture or movie film that has been processed, and is ready to be used to make a print. In a negative, everything in the picture has the opposite color.
Now: Now is the time span between the past and the future. It can be long (like an eon in geologic time) or short (like a picosecond) but it is almost always used to refer to the span between the present instant to some time horizon when a decision must be made. It can be used to ask or demand that someone make a decision even if they want to delay. "I want to know what you think, now." "What do you think now?" "Now is the time for all good people to come to the aid of their country." Mathematics and measurement assume that everything used in one equation equals the same quantities at the beginning of calculation or axiomatization as at the end.
New York City: New York, often called New York City (NYC), is the most populous city in the U.S. state of New York, and the largest city in the United States. It is at the southern end of the U.S. state of New York. Over 8 million people currently live in the city, and over 22 million people live in the bigger New York metropolitan area.

O Canada: "O Canada" () is the national anthem of Canada. Calixa Lavallée wrote the music, and Adolphe-Basile Routhier wrote the words in French. It was first sung in French in 1880. Robert Stanley Weir wrote the English words for the song, which are not a translation of the French lyrics, in 1908. It was sung as the national anthem for many years before the government made it official on 1 July (Canada Day) in 1980. "O Canada" has been translated into many languages. Some of these languages are spoken by people living in Canada, but they trace their roots in other parts of the globe.
Oahu: Oahu (or Oʻahu) is the third largest of the Hawaiian Islands, in the United States. It means "the gathering place" (a place where people meet) in the Hawaiian language. Most of the people of Hawaii live there (1.0 million of the state's 1.4 million in 2020). The total land area is . Honolulu, the capital city of Hawaii, is on this island.

Orthography: Orthography is an official or correct way to write a particular language. It includes rules of spelling. Orthography may also include rules about punctuation, capitalization, and diacritics (e.g. accents). In English, spelling is a problem for all learners, and is the main issue in orthography. Some languages have someone to decide the correct spelling, such as the Académie française. English does not. English orthography was the work of the early [[printing
Oil: The word oil is used for many different kinds of liquids. Oil usually does not mix with water. Vegetable oils are made from plants. Many are used in foods and for cooking. Some kinds of plant oils that people use are palm oil, maize (corn), olive, peanut, soy, and sunflower. Other kinds of oil are made from crude oil (petroleum), which comes from under the ground. People use large oil wells to bring the oil up to the surface. The oil is sent in special ships called tankers or in pipelines to factories called refineries where it is distilled into LPG, gasoline (petrol), diesel fuel, and fuel oil.
OK: OK (okay) is a word in the English language. It is used to mean that something is good or correct. It is the opposite of the word bad. It can often be used instead of the word Yes.

For example: I think it is 'ok' to present this project in our office.
Oxymoron: An oxymoron is a term for a figure of speech. It is made up of two or more words that seem to be opposite to each other, or actually are opposite. For example, the phrases "Wise fool", "Warm freezer", and "Legal murder" all have two words. In each one, the one word looks like the opposite of the other word. You can have words that look opposite, but are right. For example, a "warm freezer" could be right. A freezer could be warm if it was turned off or left open. The word oxymoron is an oxymoron; 'oxy' comes from the Greek word that means 'sharp', while 'moron' comes from the Greek word that means 'dull'.
Operating system: An operating system (OS) is a kind of computer program that helps a computer to interact with other machines or with people. An OS is not actually one single program but a group of small programs, like file managers, device drivers, and kernels. An OS can be small (like Damn Small Linux), or large (like Microsoft Windows). Some are meant for general use, like in a personal computer or a smartphone. Others are used for specific purposes. For example, an ATM would use a specialized kind of operating system.
Philosophy: . Roman copy of an original thought to be carved by Lysippos.]] Philosophy is the study (field) A person who works in the field of philosophy is called a philosopher. A philosopher is a kind of [[intellectual Philosophy is a way of thinking about the [[world, the universe, and society. In the past, natural sciences were a part of philosophy.
Physics: Physics is the science of how things move in space and time and how the universe works. It studies matter and it studies forces. The word physics comes from the atomic hypothesis as the single most important scientific concept, that all things are made up of atoms&nbsp;– little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another&nbsp;..." Physics can also be defined as "that department of knowledge which relates to the order of nature, or, in other words, to the regular succession of events".
Politics: Politics (from Ancient Greek πολιτικά (politiká) 'affairs of the cities') is the way that people living in groups make planned decisions. Politics is about making agreements between people so that they can live together in groups such as tribes, cities, or countries. In large groups, such as countries, some people may spend a lot of their time making such agreements. These people are called politicians. Politicians, and sometimes other people, may get together to form a government. The study of politics in universities is called political science, public affairs, government, political studies, or public administration.
Value (personal and cultural): A value (or principle) usually means an abstract rule, one that can be seen to apply in many experiences, or can be applied by choice in a lot of situations. It can also mean a moral choice one makes often and consistently, for example, some Buddhists avoid eating meat (vegetarianism) as a matter of principle. Many groups of people agree on lists of principles. They may also try to agree on the order in which they are to apply, that is, which principles should be violated before which other ones.
Profanity: s and comics, profanity is often depicted as a jumble of symbols that block offensive language. These types of symbols are called grawlixes]] Profanity is a word or action that is impolite, inappropriate, offensive, or taboo. The adjective is profane. Different words can be profane to different people and in different Culture Profanities can also be called strong words, swear words, curse words, dirty words, vulgar words, strong language, [[obscenity, vulgarity, obscene language, vulgar language, or expletives.
Proof: Proof could mean: * An argument, including: ** Mathematical proof ** Proof theory, a branch of mathematical logic ** Logical argument ** Evidence (law), tested evidence or a legal proof * Proof (alcohol), measure of an alcoholic beverage's strength * Proofing (baking technique), how a yeast-leavened dough rises * Proofreading * Artist's proof, a single print taken during the printmaking process * Proof coinage, a coin made as an example of a particular strike * Proof test, for a firearm * Galley proof, an early version of a publication * Homeopathic proving, testing a substance's effect on the...

Psychoneuroimmunology: Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) is the study of the interaction between psychological processes and the nervous and immune systems of the human body. PNI takes an interdisciplinary approach. The main interests of PNI are the interactions between the nervous and immune systems and the relationships between mental processes and health.
Political party: A political party is an organized group of people or bodies who seek to capture political power through an election in order to run the affairs of a country. It often puts forward candidates for public office. In a democracy, leaders must "run for office" in an election. In a dictatorship, there is generally only one party allowed, that can approve a new leader without non-members having a choice.
Page: A page can be different things: * Usually, a page is a physical sheet of paper in a book, magazine, newspaper etc. When a page is not in a book (etc.) it is a sheet or piece of paper. * When we talk about computers, a page is also a common abbreviation in net jargon for "webpage". Here the page is not paper, it is a piece of information which we can see on a computer monitor at one time. We can print it to make a real page. But the information may not fit all on one page, and we can not change it when it is printed - we can change a web page.
Pet: A pet is a domesticated animal that lives with people, but is not forced to work and is not eaten, in most instances. In most cases, a pet is kept to entertain people or for companionship. Some pets such as dogs and cats are placed in an animal shelter if there is no one willing to take care of them. If no one adopts it or the pet is too old/sick, the pet may be euthanized or in some cases even abandoned. Dogs, cats, fish, rodents, lagomorphs, ferrets, birds, certain reptiles and amphibians, and a wide variety of arthropods such as tarantulas and hermit crabs are the most common pets in North America.
Product: A product can mean a few things: * Product (as a general idea) is anything which results from a process. * Product (mathematics) is the result of multiplication * Product (consumer goods) in business * Product (chemistry) is a result or something that is made in a chemical reaction.
Program: The term Program can be used in many ways. *A program or programme can be a plan of how to do something. It tells the steps that we think we need to do to make something happen. For example, a government might make a program to improve the health of the people in part of a country by giving the people better food, by helping to kill insects that carry diseases, and by bringing more doctors. *A computer program is a set of computer instructions. A set of computer instructions is called Program and a set of program is called software.
Platonic realism: Platonic realism is the theory of reality developed by Plato, and explained in his theory of forms. Platonic realism states that the visible world of particular things is a shifting exhibition, like shadows cast on a wall by the activities of their corresponding universal Ideas or Forms. Whereas the visible world of particulars is unreal, the Forms occupy the unobservable yet true reality and are real. Platonism is a similar, yet sometimes modified, view of reality.
Paradox: 's self-flowing flask fills itself in this picture, but perpetual motion machines cannot exist.]] is a variant of the Liar paradox]] A paradox is a sentence in logic that cannot be true but also cannot be false. It is self-contradictory. Many famous problems of this kind exist.
Potato: A potato is a leaves. The part of the potato that people eat is a tuber that grows under the ground. Potatoes have a lot of starch and other carbohydrates. Potatoes usually have light-brown or yellowish [[skin
Plant: plant|180px]] Plants are one of six big groups (kingdoms) of living things. They are autotrophic eukaryotes, this means they have complex cells, and make their own food. Usually, they cannot move (not counting growth). Plants need sunlight, soil and water whereas seeds need warmth. Plants include familiar types such as trees, herbs, bushes, grasses, vines, ferns, mosses, and green algae. The scientific study of plants, known as botany, has identified about 391,000 extant (living) species of plants.
Prediction: A prediction is a statement that someone makes about what they think is going to happen. It is often very helpful to know what is going to happen to help prepare for these future events. Predictions are based on the idea that two beginning positions that are like each other will have similar results. By watching something happen, it is possible to predict what will happen if something similar happens. Predictions are given by science or fortune tellers or horoscopes. The most common example of a prediction is the weather forecast.
Probability: or Galton box most balls end up close to the center. In the long run, they will show a normal distribution]] Probability is a part of applied mathematics. It has to do with chance, the study of things that might happen or might not happen. For example, using probability, one can show that by throwing a coin up in the air and letting it land, half of the time it will land with one side facing up, and half of the time with the other side facing up. Many coins have a picture of the face of a famous person on one side, and something else on the other side.
Probability experiment: A probability experiment is a situation where chance affects the result of an experiment. If the experiment can only have two outcomes, it is named Bernoulli trial. A coin flip is a probability experiment because chance affects whether a coin will land heads or tails when it is flipped. theory
Protein: showing turquoise alpha helices. This protein was the first to have its structure solved by X-ray crystallography. Towards the right-center among the coils, a heme group (shown in grey) with a bound oxygen molecule (red)]] Proteins are long-chain molecules built from small units known as amino acids, which are joined in a sequence by peptide bonds. Every sequence of amino acids becomes a specific final shape, allowing living things to use proteins as tiny machines to do work. They are biochemical compounds.
Periodic table: The periodic table is a table that puts all known chemical elements in a specific order. Elements that have similar characteristics are often put near each other. In the table, the elements are placed in the order of their atomic numbers starting with the lowest number of one, hydrogen. The atomic number of an element is the same as the number of protons in that particular nucleus of an atom. In the table the elements are arranged into periods and group. A row of elements across the table is called a period.
Physiology: Physiology is the study of how living things work. Physiologists can study how organs of an organism work together to make things happen. In human beings, for example, the digestion of food hormones and other chemicals are made by the stomach, liver, and pancreas. Muscle contraction happens because of chemical messages made by nerves of that muscle. By learning how the body functions normally, physiologists and physicians can better understand what happens when organs do not function normally. For example, an understanding of how the thyroid gland functions has helped in treating goitre.
Planet: A planet is a large object such as Venus or Earth that orbits a star. Planets do not make light but can reflect light. Planets are spherical (that is, ball-shaped), because their gravity compresses them into a sphere. Jupiter is the biggest planet in the Solar System, while the smallest planet in the Solar System is Mercury. Planets are shaped like a slightly squashed ball (called a spheroid). Objects that orbit planets are called satellites. A star and everything which orbits it are called a star system.
Political problems of China: The People's Republic of China claims that the island of Taiwan is part of its territory, but the Republic of China, which was the government that controlled all of China from 1911 to 1949, still claims the land and controls Taiwan. The government stops people from having freedom of speech, freedom of religion and other political rights that people in other countries have. China is a dictatorship, not a democracy. protest in 2010]]
Police: Police are a group of people whose job is to enforce laws, help with emergencies, solve crimes and protect property. A person who carries out this duty is known as a police officer. They work out of a police station. Police are trained in first aid and rescue, because police officers are often one of the first people to get to a place where people are sick or injured, such as a car accident, or a fire.
Pi: Pi () () is a mathematical constant that is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. This produces a number, and that number is always the same. However, the number is rather strange. The number starts as 3.141592653589793... and continues without end. Numbers like this are called irrational numbers. The diameter is the largest chord (line between two points on a circle) which can be fitted inside a circle. It passes through the center of the circle. The distance around a circle is known as the circumference.
Proper noun: A proper noun or proper name is a noun representing a unique thing (like London, Jupiter, John Hunter, or Toyota), unlike a common noun, which represents a type of thing (like city, planet, person or corporation). Proper nouns are the only nouns in English which always have the first letter capitalized. In English, proper nouns don't usually come after an article or other limiting modifier (such as any or some). They are used for a particular person, place, or object. For example, a town called "Newtown" may be, but does not necessarily have to be, a new [recently built] town).
Plastic: A plastic is a material that can change its shape easily. Many things are made of plastics, usually because making them to the right shape is easy. Some plastics have other materials added to them, like glass, because they make the plastic stronger and stiffer. Plastics are used to make many products, including nylon or polyester clothing; toys; electronics; food containers; pipes; bags; parachutes; ropes; car parts; medical supplies; bulletproof glass; and body armor.
Product stewardship: Product stewardship is a way of managing the environmental impacts of different products and materials. People involved in producing, selling, using and disposing of products have a shared responsibility to manage them in a way that reduces their impact, throughout their lifecycle, on the environment and on human health and safety. This includes waste disposal measures in the distribution of an industrial product. That is, paying for the safe and proper disposal when you pay for the product, and relying on those who sold it to you, to dispose of it.
Peace: Peace is a time without any fights or wars. In a larger sense, peace (or peacefulness) can mean a state of harmony, quiet or calm that is not disturbed by anything at all, like a still pond with no ripples. Many people and organizations want peace. One organization that was set up to bring peace among the nations and try to make war a thing of the past was the League of Nations after World War I. When it did not stop World War II, it was replaced by the United Nations which tries to make the world peaceful.
Quebec: Quebec ( or ; ) is a province in the eastern part of Canada located between the Hudson Bay and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. It is the biggest of Canada's 10 provinces by size. It also has the second-largest population, after Ontario. Most of Quebec's inhabitants live along or near the banks of the Saint Lawrence River. Not many people live in the north of the province. Quebec borders the Canadian provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick and the U.S. states of New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.
Reading: Reading is understanding writing in a language. Fundamentally, reading is the way people look at certain marks and know what they mean. Once it was possible to go through life without reading. Writing goes back in human history only a few thousand years, and 200 years ago most men could not read or write. We know this is true because they could not write their own names on marriage records in churches. Most men worked in farming, and you can do most of that job without being able to read. The wives could read: they lived at home before marriage and their mothers taught them.
Religion: Religion is a set of beliefs and social-cultural systems, including certain practices, morals, beliefs and worldviews, that relate humanity to supernatural or spiritual elements—though there is no current fully agreed definition on what a religion exactly is. Different religions may or may not have different parts about the divine, sacredness, faith and a supernatural being or beings. Religion often answers questions about the origin, nature, and purpose of existence, usually including a belief in supernatural entities, such as deities or spirits that have power in the natural world.
Recreation: Recreation or fun is a person's time of refreshing his or her body and mind. There are many different forms of recreation which are shaped by individual interests and by environment; a few examples being reading, playing or listening to music, watching movies or TV, gardening, hunting, hobbies, sports, studies, and travel. These activities are just some of a wide variety of recreation activity available in day-to-day life. Public places such as parks and beaches are very important for many recreational activities.
Red: , Tamil Nadu, India]] coordinated machine in Japan]] the a for Africa]] Red is the color that is on the edge of the rainbow. It is one of the primary colors (colors that can be mixed with other colors) of light. The others are blue and yellow. Red light has a wavelength between 630 and 740 nanometers. Red paint can be made by mixing yellow paint and magenta paint. Red is sometimes used to mark things that are wrong, important or dangerous. It is also used as a warning to stop.
Raw food: *For the WWE brand/TV Show, see WWE Raw. Foods are raw when they are not cooked. Most things are safe to eat raw, but some of them can be poisonous.
Ram: Ram can mean: * A male sheep that has not been neutered * Random-access memory (abbreviated "RAM") * Battering ram, something used to break through walls or doors * Hydraulic ram, a type of pump * Rama (or Râm), a Hindu god
Roman Empire: The Roman Empire ruled the Mediterranean and much of Europe, Western Asia and North Africa. The Romans conquered most of this damn the Republic, and it was ruled by emperors following Octavian's assumption of effective sole rule in 27 BC. The western empire collapsed in 476 AD, but the eastern empire, the Byzantine Empire, lasted until the fall of Constantinople in 1453. The Empire started in 27 BC, when Octavian became Emperor Augustus after the death of Julius Caesar. The fall of Western Roman Empire to the Germanic kings in 476 AD, marked the end of classical antiquity and the beginning of the Middle Ages.
Regime: A regime is the leader and other people who run a government of a sovereign state. There are many kinds of regimes. They can achieve power in many ways. Depending on the time and place and local civics like the electoral system, they can lose power in many ways too. The most common way for a regime to lose power was a coup, invasion or revolution until the 20th century. After that it became very dangerous and difficult to use these methods. Peaceful regime change is usually by an election - this method is now used by more than half the people on the Earth.
River: in London, England. People have lived along the banks of this river for thousands of years.]] A river is a stream of water that flows through a channel on the surface of the ground. The passage where the river flows is called the riverbed and the earth on each side is called a riverbank. A river begins on high ground or in hills or mountains and flows down from the high ground to the lower ground, because of gravity. A river begins as a small stream and gets bigger the farther it flows.
Right angle: indicates that this is a right angle]] A right angle is an angle with a measurement of 90 degrees or π/2 radians. While most angles are represented by a small sliver of a circle in their angle, right angles have a small square instead. This is why something that is 90 degrees is often referred to as "square" in woodworking. When two lines cross each other so that all the angles have the same size, the result is four right angles. This is known as "perpendicular". The top of the letter T is at right angles to the vertical line.
Reward: A reward is getting something good for doing a given task. It needs someone who has the power to give the good thing. It is part of reinforcement that primarily deals with rewards and reliefs. Ideas like reinforcement unlike punishment that is based on cost and losses function based on the idea that people increase doing things to get rewards is an alternative to punishment that forces to avoid things. In philosophy there is another idea that says that training and discipline (conditioning) are much more important than the rewards or punishments given by others.
Ranch: A ranch is a farm for raising cows, horses, sheep or other livestock. Most ranches are large, but they can be any size. The word ranch is from the Spanish word "rancho". It is used in American and Canadian English. People who use a ranch are called ranchers. A ranch may be on private or public land. The desert areas of the western United States have many ranches, because there is much land that is not very good for crops. There are also many in desert areas of Australia, where they are called stations. Someone who takes care of the livestock may be called a stockman or cowboy.
SUV: J300]] A sports utility vehicle, also known as a sport utility van or simply an SUV or a sport utility car, is a type of vehicle which combines the load-hauling and versatility of a pickup truck with the passenger-carrying space of a minivan, hatchback, station wagon, or large sedan. It is built as a rugged vehicle for cargo and passenger carrying. Originally SUVs were not designed to be fuel efficient but modern designs are getting better fuel mileage. In 2014 US sales of SUVs were over five million vehicles.
Substance: Substance is the material, or matter, of which something is made. Substances are physical things that can be seen, touched, or measured. They are made up of one or more elemental parts. Iron and aluminium, which are pure, water and air, which are mixtures; are all examples of substances. and liquid water are two different forms of the same chemical substance, water.]]
September: September (Sep.) is the ninth month of the year in the Gregorian calendar, coming between August and October. It has 30 days. Its name comes from the Latin word sept for "seven" (it was the seventh month of the year, before January and February were added to the beginning of the year.) September always begins on the same day of the week as December, but never ends on the same day of the week as any other month.
Sound: :Sound can also mean a body of water, like a bay or channel. Sound is caused by waves of pressure called sound waves. It can be heard when it goes through a medium to the ear. All sounds are made by vibrations of molecules. For example, when a person hits a drum or a cymbal the object vibrates. These vibrations make air molecules move. Sound waves move away from where they came from. When the vibrating air molecules reach our ears, the eardrum vibrates, too. The bones of the ear vibrate in the way the object that started the sound wave vibrates.
Society: Society is the term to describe human beings together as a collective entity – the sum of their social networks and social interactions.
Suggestion: A suggestion is an idea that one suggests, or says is good for another (or others) to follow. Some people may agree to it, and some may disagree. If they disagree or have a different suggestion, the person who first suggested the idea will usually discuss with the other people and find a good conclusion that satisfies both and is good. A suggestion is someone's opinion on how to do any task, but a person is not necessarily expected to do it.
Spache Readability Formula: Spache Readability Formula is one method of finding out how hard a piece of writing is (its textual difficulty). The method compares words in a text to a list of words which are familiar in everyday writing. The words that are not on the list are called unfamiliar. The number of words per sentence are counted. This number and the percentage of unfamiliar words is put into a formula. The result is a reading age. Someone of this age should be able to read the text. Spache works best on texts that are for children under the age of eight.
Sport: is one of the most popular sports in the world. In this image, a striker is shooting the ball to score a goal.]] and the African football]] Sport usually means athletic games that involve a degree of competition, such as netball, basketball or cross-country Olympic skiing. Some games and many kinds of racing are called sports. A professional at a sport is called an athlete. Many people do sports with their friends. They need coaches to teach or train teams or individuals how to do better. Sports can be played indoors or outdoors and by individuals or team.
Science: Science is what we do to find out about the natural world. 'Science' also refers to the large amount of knowledge that has been found using this process. Research uses the scientific method. Scientific research uses hypotheses based on ideas or earlier knowledge, which can be categorized through different topics. Then those hypotheses are tested by experiments. People who study and research science and try to find out everything about it are called scientists. Scientists study things by looking at them very carefully, by measuring them, and by doing experiments and tests.
Saint Lawrence River: The Saint Lawrence River (; Tuscarora: Kahnawáʼkye; Mohawk: Kaniatarowanenneh, meaning "big waterway") is a big river in eastern North America. It flows between the Canadian province of Quebec & Ontario and the American state of New York, and through the major Canadian city of Montreal. It is the third largest river in Canada. The river drains water from the Great Lakes into the Atlantic Ocean. It is more than three thousand kilometres long. The river meets the Atlantic Ocean in a big "estuary" or bay, the biggest in the world; this is called the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.
Seville: Seville () is a city in the southern parts of Spain. A river called the Guadalquivir River goes through Seville. The city of Seville is the capital of the Spanish autonomous community Andalusia and of the province of Sevilla. People from Seville are called Sevillanos.
Salami: Salami is a sausage that first came from Italy. The name comes from the Italian salare meaning to make something salty. The original salami was made from a mix of chopped pork and salt which was dried using air in a casing. Now there are many types of salamis made in some countries. Nearly all are seasoned with a combination of herbs and spices in addition to salt. Salamis are now sometimes smoked or cooked before air drying. Some kinds are made of beef while others mix beef and pork. Most, if not all Italian salamis have garlic in them, but few German kinds do, for example.
Special English: Special English is a simple form of the English language. It is used by a public radio station called Voice of America, run by the United States government in Special English programs every day. Its news and feature programs are read more slowly than usual, using fewer English words and simple grammar. The contents of Special English programs are much easier to understand. Special English is clearer and simpler, and it uses shorter sentences. It can also help someone whose English is weak to improve their English.
Sausage: 2008]] Sausage is a food made of ground-up or chopped-up meat or meat with other ingredients. It often has spices in it and is covered in a casing. Traditionally, a sausage casing is made of animal intestine, but can sometimes be made of plastic. There are many forms of sausages, including hot dog, pepperoni, bologna, and salami. Sausages often have meat from the animal's head, lips, cheeks, ears and other parts. Some have blood in them. German and British sausages normally have a lot of "rusk," or bread crumbs, and they are less meaty than sausages from other countries.
Slang: Slang are words that are informal. Usually each generation or social group has its own slang - for example, older people can have trouble understanding the slang of younger people. On the other hand, younger people often understand, but find silly or old-fashioned, the slang of older people. Over time, language tends to get more complex, since new words enter much faster than old words leave. Over time, slang almost always becomes part of the language, and approved for use by all. It has also happened that some words used in Anglo-Saxon for bodily functions became thought of as profanity or ru...
Social contract: A social contract or political contract is a perceived agreement among the people of a state about the rules that will define their government. These rules are usually called laws. Laws help to make sure people have rights and that their rights are protected. One kind of social contract is a constitution. A constitution says how decisions are made, and sets limits on the powers of leaders and other people who have authority. In the Age of Enlightenment, philosophers Thomas Hobbes, John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote books about social contracts.
Social capital: Social capital is made when people spend time with others and build good relationships. It is the help and worth that a person can get from their ties with other people. Social capital is like real capital. When a person or a group has more capital, it is easier to do things, and life is better. When there is less capital, life becomes harder, and the results are not good for people. The name social capital was first used by Pierre Bourdieu in 1977. He said it means all the real or possible help a person can get by being part of a group where people know each other and Nan Lin said that social capital comes from two things: what someone has, and who they know.
Site: A site is a real fixed physical location where something will or has happened or a place where something is.
Subtraction: Subtraction is the arithmetic operation for finding the difference between two numbers, though it can also be generalized to other mathematical objects such as vectors and seven minus four equals three", "seven take away four leaves three", or "four from seven leaves three". If the minuend is less than the subtrahend, the difference will be a negative number. For example, 17-25=-8. This can be read as "seventeen minus twenty-five equals negative eight". Subtraction is how cash registers determine the change a buyer receives, when the buyer pays with more money than the purchase cost.
String theory: String theory tries to use math to explain the four known fundamental forces—gravitation, electromagnetism, strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force—together in one theory. This tries to solve the problems of having both classical physics and quantum physics. Einstein wanted a unified field theory, a single theory to explain the fundamental forces. Today's scientists want a unified field theory that also explains matter. This is called the search for a theory of everything (TOE). The most famous theory used as a TOE is called superstring theory.
Scientist: A scientist is a person who studies or has mastered the field in science. A scientist tries to understand how our world, or other things, work. Scientists make observations, ask questions and do extensive research work in finding the answers to many questions. Scientists may work in laboratories for governments, companies, schools and research institutions. Some scientists teach at universities and other places and train people to become scientists. Scientists often do experiments to find out more about reality, and sometimes may repeat experiments or use control groups.
Soapbox: A soapbox is a temporary platform used to give a speech. During the 19th century, soap was transported in wooden boxes. When a person had new or unusual ideas, and wanted to talk to a crowd about them, sometimes he or she would stand on an empty soapbox so that everyone could see and hear the talk well. People sometimes use the word "soapbox" to mean a place to say new or unusual things.
Supernatural: The word supernatural (from ) is used for things that some people believe are real, but that are not part of nature or can’t be explained by the scientific laws of nature. Because we cannot prove whether these things are real, people often disagree about these things. Some say that we should talk about things without talking about the supernatural, because we cannot prove that supernatural things are real. Other people say that although we cannot prove supernatural things in a scientific way, they are real.
Spirit: A spirit, otherwise referred to as a phantom, is considered to be the part of a being that is not the body. Other words with the same meanings are soul and ghost. When a body is alive, it has a spirit in it. Death is when the spirit separates from the body. Christians believe that spirits exist in Heaven or Hell. (See 1 Timothy 3:16, 4:1) Spiritualists believe that spirits can talk with people, or change things in the world. Many religions forbid communicating with such spirits in any way, (see Leviticus 19:31) but a few include this as part of their practice.
Seed: seeds]] A seed is the part of a seed plant which can grow into a new plant. It is a reproductive structure which disperses, and can survive for some time. A typical seed includes three basic parts: (1) an embryo, (2) a supply of nutrients for the embryo, and (3) a seed coat. There are many different kinds of seeds. Some plants make a lot of seeds, some make only a few. Seeds are often hard and very small, but some are larger. The coconut is as big as a child's head, but it contains more than just a seed.
Sail: A sail is a large piece of cloth on the top of some boats. The wind goes around the sail and makes the boat move through the water. The piece that the sail is attached to is called a mast. Some boats have many sails, and some have only one. Usually, small boats have only one sail, and bigger boats have more. Boats with sails are called sailing boats. There are many different names for different kinds of sailing boats with different kinds of sails. Before people made boats with engines that used coal or oil, sailing boats were an important way to travel across oceans.
Spanish: The word Spanish means: * from or about the country of Spain, such as a person from Spain or food from Spain *Spanish people * the Spanish language *Spanish Empire
Skin: The skin is the outer covering of mammals and some other animals. It has many purposes. First of all, it is a defense against the entry of pathogens such as bacteria and parasites. Second, it regulates (keeps in control) the body's temperature. It allows evaporation from its surface, and adjusts it. It is a physical defense, very strong in some animals, but rather weak in humans. The skin and hair on mammals has several purposes. In addition to temperature regulation and defense, some hair is used for signaling.
Search engine: A search engine is a website that allows users to look up information on the World Wide Web (WWW), part of the Internet. The search engine will achieve this by looking at many web pages to find matches to the user's search inputs. It will return results ranked by relevancy and popularity by the search engine. The most popular search-engines are Google Search and Bing. There are other popular search engines too, such as Baidu, Brave Search and Yandex. Older services include Webcrawler are, Yahoo! Search, Ask.
Sabbath in Christianity: Sabbath in Christianity is the day of rest and service to God. The idea of the Sabbath in Christianity comes directly from the idea of the Shabbat in Judaism. The word Sabbath comes from the Hebrew word Shabbat. Like the Shabbat, the Sabbath in Christianity comes from the Genesis story of Creation. But unlike Jews, most Christians have Sabbath on Sunday, not Saturday. They also rest, but not the same way as Jews. The exact way depends on the church denomination.
Statistics: in Statistics]] Statistics is a branch of applied mathematics that deals with collecting, organizing, analyzing, reading and presenting data. Descriptive statistics make summaries of data. Inferential statistics makes predictions. Statistics helps in the study of many other fields, such as science, medicine, economics, psychology, politics and marketing. Someone who works in statistics is called a statistician. In addition to being the name of a field of study, the word "statistics" can also mean numbers that are used to describe data or relationships.
Server log: A server log records what is happening on a server at any time. For example, an HTTP server runs a web site. de:Logdatei
Server: A server is a computer that serves many kinds of information to a user or client machine. Usually a server will only do a few things for many clients. Every type of thing a server does is called a service. Services are used by other computers that are called clients. The relationship between client and server is called a client-server relationship. For example, Wikipedia has web servers which have a service for sending web pages over the Internet. Your client computer talks to Wikipedia's web page service to get web pages for you.
Simile: A simile is a figure of speech that compares two different things, usually by using the words 'like' or 'as'. It is used to make a direct and clear comparison between two things .Similes may be confused with metaphors, which do the same kind of thing. Similes use comparisons, with the words 'like' or 'as'. Metaphors use indirect comparisons, without the words 'like' or 'as'. *Similes: **Like a hungry wolf, he ate the food. **A dragonfly is like a plane: they both fly and cannot close their wings.
State: . ]] In politics, a state is the government of a country which has control over a geographic area or territory. States have three main features: *Control over a geographic area, or territory *A people, the population of the state. *Institutions which have the power to make laws. There are different forms of government a state may have, for example a republic or a monarchy. Sometimes states form their own countries. In its origin the United States had different kinds of states, but they agreed to join together.
Stream: A stream is a natural flow of water moving across land between banks. It is smaller than a river. The primary meaning of stream is a body of water, confined within a bed and banks, and detectably flowing. Synonyms or related words include river, creek, tributary, run, branch, brook, bourne, wash, and fork. Navigable streams are sometimes called waterways, though the term may apply to any size of permanent and natural water feature except oceans. In the United States, an intermittent stream that only flows for part of the year is marked on topographic maps with a line of blue dashes and dots.
Solar System: s and dwarf planets of the Solar System. Compared with each other, the sizes are correct, but the distances are not]] The Solar System is a group of space objects that are held together by gravity, with the Sun in the center. The Sun is a huge ball of hot glowing gas that gives off light and heat. Everything else in the Solar System moves around the Sun. The Solar System formed about 4.6 billion years ago when a giant cloud of gas and dust collapsed and started to spin. Most of the material went into forming the Sun, and the rest became planets and other objects.
Saturn: Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun in our solar system. On average, Saturn is about 1,432,000,000 km (870,000,000 mi) away from the Sun. Saturn takes about 29.5 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun. A day on Saturn is much shorter than a day on Earth, lasting only about 10.7 hours. This means that Saturn spins much faster than Earth, spinning more than twice in the same time it takes Earth to spin once. Saturn is one of the four giant planets in our solar system, along with Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune.
Slavery: slaves in Cuba being tortured during the 19th century.]] Slavery is when a person is treated as the property of another person. This person is usually called a slave, and the owner is called a slavemaster. It often means that slaves are forced to work, or else they will be punished by the law (if slavery is legal in that place) or by their master. There is evidence that even before there was writing, there was slavery. Almost all cultures and continents have a history of slavery. Some societies had laws about slavery or had an economy that was built on it.
Soul: Many philosophies and religions say that a soul is a supernatural essence of a living human being that lives after death. It is usually said to be immortal. It cannot be discovered by science, because it cannot be tested in any controlled way. Many different opinions exist as to what happens to personal experience after death. Reincarnation is a belief that after the body dies, the soul will be born again in another body. It is important to Hinduism. Buddhists understand the idea of an eternal soul, and the idea of simple annihilation as delusion; they say that there is no unchanging, permanent self, soul or essence in phenomena.
Soap: Soap is a chemical compound resulting from the reaction of an alkali (commonly sodium or potassium hydroxide) with a fatty acid. Soaps are the metallic salts of long chain fatty acids. When mixed with water during bathing, cleansing, or washing, they help people and clothes get clean by lowering the chance of dirt and oil to get to the skin or fabric. Soaps are made from animal fats or vegetable oils. There are two basic steps in making soap. They are called Saponification and Salting-out of soap.
Summary: A summary is a condensed explanation of an event, story, document, etc.. i.e. "summing up the facts." They are not constrained to any medium or topics. Not to be confused with abstract, which is a summary of a document. There are many different levels of summarization that can be done. The summarizer may choose any length, but the sumarees may not appreciate anything more than absolutely necessary to get the required facts. Summaries help to spread information fast. They also help people make decisions on if it is something worth looking further into.
Service economy: A service is a job or work done for someone else. All the service trades form a service economy. Good examples are: *Government is perhaps the largest example. *Hospitals and the health services generally. *Banks and financial services. *Motor trade services. All services except actual products such as parts and petrol (which are obviously goods or products). *Painting a house as opposed to building it. The old split between product and service is now often a service–product continuum. Many products are being transformed into services.
Sense: There are several meanings of the word sense. This page is for disambiguation - there are more detailed articles on each meaning: When a word has several meanings, one can refer to it as being used "in the sense of..." some context or other. In Simple English for instance we avoid using words in unusual senses.
Synagogue: A synagogue is a place where Jews meet to worship and pray to God. In Hebrew, a synagogue is called beit knesset, which means, a "house of gathering". The word "synagogue" comes from sunagoge, which is a Greek word. In a synagogue, Jews carry out the Jewish services, which consist of prayers, sometimes with special actions. A synagogue will usually have a large room for prayers. There might be some smaller rooms for studying. There will be some offices. There will also usually be a big room for special events.
Scarcity: Scarcity in economics is the lack of various forms of capital. Scarcity can be used to describe an economic situation in economics, or it can be used to describe more general situations. In economics, scarcity is the result of people having "Unlimited Wants and Needs," or always wanting something new, and having "Limited Resources." Limited Resources means that there are never enough resources, or materials, to satisfy, or fulfill, the wants and needs that every person have. Scarcity is called the "basic economic problem," meaning that it always exists.
Readability: Readability, or textual difficulty, means how easy or hard a text is to read. Research has shown that two main factors affect the ease with which texts are read. #How difficult the words are: this is lexical difficulty. Rare words are less well known than common words. Rare, difficult words are often longer than common, easy words. #How difficult the sentences are: this is syntactical difficulty. Long, complicated sentences cause more difficulty than short, simple sentences.
Theatre: and comedy]] Theatre (British English and also American English), or Theater (mostly American English), has several meanings. The word comes originally from the Greek Theatron, meaning roughly, 'a place for viewing'. In American English, the word 'theater' can mean either a place where films are shown (this is also called a cinema) or a place where live stage plays are performed. In British English, 'theatre' means a place where live plays are performed. Some people, both English and American, use the spelling 'theatre' to mean a place where live plays are performed, and the spelling 'theater' to mean a cinema.
Test: A test is a way of checking something to see if it is true, or false, or if it is edible or not. If something can be tested, or finishes the tests correctly, it is testable. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines a test as: "a procedure intended to establish the quality, performance, or reliability of something". A test is different from an experiment: Before a test is done, there is an expected result. The test is performed, to show this result. In an experiment, the outcome is open. Very often, tests are performed as part of an experiment.
Time horizon: A time horizon is a future point in time when something must be "done" (a "deadline") or will be "over" (a "time limit"). Either way, the matter will be closed when the time horizon is reached. Common time horizons people use are: *end of day, usually meaning the working day; *the weekend; *end of month; *fiscal quarter; *end of school term; *end of calendar year *and end of fiscal year. It is very important to know at what time horizon something you are doing will be scored, evaluated, marked or paid for.
Time limit: A time limit is a time horizon that is imposed on everyone at once. It may be used to try to achieve fairness in some system of ethics. For instance, if poor people and rich people are debating something, a time limit may be imposed so that the rich people cannot keep debating until the poor people have to go to work, and lose. Time limits are very important in accounting so that everyone can report their results (for tax and investment purposes) at the same time. This in turn creates deadlines for the accountant and those reporting.
Taiwan: The Republic of China (ROC; Chinese: 中華民國; pinyin: Zhōnghuá Mínguó), commonly known as Taiwan, is a disputed self-governing region off the coast of mainland China in East Asia. The Republic of China once governed all of China (from 1911 to 1949) but moved to the island of Taiwan after their defeat in a Chinese civil war. Though ROC still de jure includes mainland China as its official territory, but its de facto territory is only the main island of Taiwan plus nearby islands (Pescadores islands and parts of Fujian).
Trademark: A trademark (or trade mark) is a way for a business to help people identify the products that the business makes from the products made by another business. A trademark can be a name, word, phrase, symbol, logo, design, or picture. It can only be used on things made by the business that owns the trademark. For example, Coca-Cola and Coke are trademark names for a certain drink made by the Coca-Cola Company. No other business can use these names or any names similar to them. Other businesses can make a drink that is similar, like colas soft drinks, but they have to use a different name for their drink, such as Pepsi.
Ten Commandments: ]] The Ten Commandments are a set of rules or laws. The Bible says that God gave them to the people of Israel. The commandments exist in different versions. One version can be found in the Book of Exodus of the Bible. Another version can be found in the Book of Deuteronomy. In the Book of Exodus, the mountain where they were given is called Mount Sinai, the Book of Deuteronomy talks about Mount Horeb (the same Mount Horeb where God called Moses from the burning bush, Exodus 3:1-3). Both are probably names for the same mountain.
Table: Table may mean one of these: *Table (furniture) *Table (information) **Periodic table **Lookup table
Tree: in its autumn colours]] , Turkey]] tree in Costa Rica. Locally known as Guanacaste]] A tree is a tall plant with a trunk and branches made of wood. Trees can live for many years. The oldest living tree found is about 5,000 years old. The oldest tree from the UK is about 1,000 years old. The four main parts of a tree are the roots, the trunk, the branches, and the leaves. Trees are a wide variety of plant species that have independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight.
Tragedy (Greek theatre): In theatre, a tragedy as defined by Aristotle is a play that ends badly for the hero or heroine or others. A tragedy is usually about a person who has many good qualities, but also has one poor quality (called a "tragic flaw") that causes trouble for him, and maybe his family or friends. Often in a tragedy, there is one possible event that the hero fears and tries to prevent, but no matter what he does, it makes this thing more and more sure to happen. Tragedies originated in Ancient Greek theatre, where they were performed at religious festivals.
Taxonomy: Taxonomy is a branch of biology. It is about the laws and principles of classifying living things. From one type of taxonomy, many classifications might be produced.
Temple: , Italy.]] A temple is a building where people go to practice their religion. In a temple people may perform religious rituals, ceremonies, and pray. Thus, a temple is a general term for a house of worship. Christians usually call their religious buildings churches. Some examples of temples from different religions: *Hinduism (Mandir) *Buddhism (Shaolin) *Temples at Uppsala *Greek temple *Temple in Jerusalem *Mormon temple *Roman temple *Reform Judaism's synagogues. *Baha'i (Mashriqu'l-Adhkar) *Temples in Bangkok
Theft: is left]] Theft is when one person or group takes from another person, business, or state any object, money, or information without permission and does not intend to return it. A person who has been convicted of theft may be called a thief. However, the practice of engaging in theft is also called stealing. There are many different types of theft, such as pickpocketing and shoplifting. Burglary and robbery are separate crimes which involve theft. Stealing is basic and is illegal almost everywhere.
United Kingdom: The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, often shortened to the United Kingdom (UK), or just Britain (US), is a sovereign country in Northwestern Europe. It is a constitutional monarchy of four countries: England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Although these are called "countries", none of them are in the UN and they all have to listen to the British King and the British Parliament. The UK borders the Republic of Ireland on the island of Ireland. It is part of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations; NATO, and the G7' the Five Eyes.
Universe: The universe is space and everything in it. It is made of many billions of stars and planets and enormous clouds of gas separated by big spaces. The Big Bang started the expansion of the universe. image of the Cosmic Microwave Backround|thumb]] Astronomers use telescopes to look at distant galaxies. This is how they see what the universe looked like a long time ago. The past tense is because the light from distant parts of the Universe takes a very long time to reach us. From these observations, it seems the physical laws and constants of the universe have not changed.
Unit of measurement: of a liquid]] : They hold one litre of beer]] Units of measurement give standards so that the numbers from our measurements refer to the same thing. Measurement is a process that uses numbers to describe a physical quantity. We can measure how big things are, how warm they are, how heavy they are, and many other features. For example, the metre is a standard unit to measure length. Before 1982, one meter was defined as the distance between two markers on a special metal rod. During that time, saying that something had a length of two meters meant that it was exactly twice as long as the rod used to define the meter.
United States customary units: U.S. customary units are the main defacto official system of units of measurement used to measure things in the United States and U.S. territories (except in Puerto Rico and Guam, where the metric system is also officially used and is dominant). The system of Imperial units, on which the U.S. customary units are based, is very similar but there are some differences. Length or distance units include the inch, foot, yard and mile. Land units include square miles (2589998.47032 square meter) and acres (4046.
Uranus: Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun in our Solar System. Like Neptune, it is an ice giant. It is the third largest planet in the solar system. The planet is made of ice, gases and liquid metal. Its atmosphere has hydrogen, helium and methane. The temperature on Uranus is near the top of its atmosphere. Its small solid core (about 55% the mass of Earth) is probably about . The planet is tilted on its many small ones, and a small system of 13 planetary rings. The distance between Uranus and the Sun is about 2.
University: A university is a higher learning institution. The word university comes from the Latin universitas magistrorum et scholarium, roughly meaning "community of teachers and scholars". Students can go to university to get an academic degree. Unlike the schooling they have done before, the courses at university are specialised. A person studying biology at university has many courses about biology and fewer courses in other fields such as languages or history. To get a higher degree, people must do some research.
Value: Value is how much something is worth. Often the best way to find the value of something is to use the price that it can be sold for. However Oscar Wilde wrote that 'people know the price of everything but the value of nothing'- in other words true value does not depend on money alone. In math, a value is a number which is concrete, something everyone can agree upon. However people may disagree on the value of water, depending if you live in a desert or next to a river. Disagreements on the value of things can create fights between nations, political parties, religions, etc. English 850 words
Volapük: Volapük (pronounced in English, in Volapük) is a constructed language created in 1880 by Johann Martin Schleyer. Schleyer was a Catholic priest from Germany. He felt that God had told him in a dream to make an international language. The name "Volapük" comes from the words "vol" (world) and "pük" (language). Volapük conventions took place in 1884, 1887, and 1889. The aim was to help people from different cultures speak to each other. Volapük became less popular after 1887 when Esperanto was published.
Vocabulary: . Today, the online and CD versions are more used.]] The vocabulary a person uses is all the words that person knows and uses. In general, a person who is five years old knows about 4,000 to 5,000 words. Adults who have gone to college may know 20,000 words.
Vegetable oil: is a common vegetable oil, used for Mediterranean cuisine.]] Vegetable oils are triglyceride oils made from plants. They are used in food and for cooking. In past centuries they were much used as fuel in oil lamps. Some kinds of plant oils that people use are palm oil, maize, olive, peanut, rapeseed, soy, and sunflower. Margarine is an artificial butter made from vegetable oil.
Verb: A verb is a kind of word (part of speech) that tells about an action or a state. It is the main part of a sentence: every sentence has a verb. In English, verbs are the only kind of word that changes to show past or present Grammatical tense Every [[language in the world has verbs, but they are not always used in the same ways. They also can have different properties in different languages. In some other languages (Chinese & Indonesian, for example) verbs do not change for past and present tense.
Volume: :This article is about physical object; for meaning from audio field, see loudness. The volume of an object is a measure of the amount of space occupied by that object, and is not to be confused with mass. The volume of a mountain is much larger than the volume of a rock, for instance. By convention, the word volume implies a three-dimensional context where: * The length is the longest distance between the object's extremities. * The width (or breadth) refers to the size of the object in a direction perpendicular to its length.
Venus: Venus is the second planet from the Sun. Venus is the only planet in the Solar System that has a day longer than a year. The year length of Venus is 225 Earth days. The day length of Venus is 243 Earth days.
Vatican City: Vatican City (; officially Vatican City State, ) (also sometimes referred to as the Vatican) is the smallest country in the world by size, at 0.49&nbsp;km² and by population. It is also one of the world's three city-states. Its territory is completely surrounded by Italy and it is only one of three countries in the world that are enclaves of another country (the others being San Marino, also in Italy, and Lesotho in southern Africa). Also, it is the only country in the world that is an enclave of a city, as all of the land around it is part of Rome, the capital of Italy.
Velocity: Velocity is a measure of how fast something moves in a particular direction. To define it needs both magnitude and direction. If an object moves east at 9 metres per second (9&nbsp;m/s), then its velocity is 9&nbsp;m/s to the east. The idea behind this is that speed does not tell us in which direction the object moves in a given frame of reference. Speed is one part of velocity, direction is the other part. Depending on the frame of reference, the velocity can be defined with many mathematical concepts required for making the correct analysis.
Virtual community: A virtual community is a group of people who share an interest, hobby or set of views. The people in it may come from many different places. They talk with each other using technology, such as the Internet, telephone calls, texting, video calls and email.

Water: : liquid (including the clouds, which are aerosols), solid (ice) and gas (water vapour)]] Water () is a simple chemical compound made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. It is clear, has no taste or smell, and is almost colorless. All living things need water to survive. Water molecules stick together because of hydrogen bonds. These bonds give water special properties. For example, water has high surface tension, and can dissolve many substances. Water exists in three forms on Earth: solid (ice), liquid (water), and gas (water vapor).
Want: A want is a wish or a desire for something. If a person would like to have something, but can choose not to have it, that thing is wanted or can be called a want.

A year is actually almost 365.25 days long, but the Gregorian and Julian calendar has 365 days, except in a leap year, which has 366 days. The year starts on January 1 and ends on December 31 in the Gregorian and Julian calendar. A fiscal year or a school year can start or end on a different day. There are several ways used to measure the length of a year.
You: You is a second-person English pronoun. The word can be singular or plural. It is what a person says when he or she is addressing another person in second person.

Chinese includes many regional language varieties, the main ones being Mandarin, Wu, Yue and Min, and are not mutually intelligible Many of the regional varieties are themselves a number of non-mutually-intelligible subvarieties. As a result, many linguists refer to these varieties as separate languages. "Chinese" can refer to the written or the spoken languages.
Zoology: Zoology is the science of studying animal life. It is part of biology. Animal life is classified into groups called phyla, of which there are at least thirty. Zoologists are scientists who study animals. They may work in laboratories, or do field research. The methods are many and various. At the heart, they cover the structure, function, ecology and evolution of animals. The structure is investigated by dissection, and microscopic examination. The function is investigated by observation and experiment.

Jail: A jail (also spelled gaol) is a protected place where people are locked up. The police or other, similar groups, who are meant to protect people, are in charge of it. Some of the people locked in jails are: *People who might have done something against the law (doing this is a crime) and have not yet been to court (where whether or not they did it is found out for sure), or who cannot pay the bail amount set by the court, or who the court thinks are too dangerous to be let out. *People whose court trial is still happening.
Prison: , a prison on an island, in Cuba]] A prison or jail is a facility where people are held against their will, as a punishment or in pretrial detention. The main cause for imprisonment is breaking the law. Those who break the law and are convicted (found guilty) in court can receive a prison sentence, which is an order to spend an amount of time in prison. Prisons are usually run by the government. People in prisons are called prisoner or inmates. Prisons are core parts of most countries' Justice systems.
Mexico: Mexico officially the United Mexican States, is a country in North America. It borders the United States to the north, and Guatemala and Belize to the southeast; while having maritime boundaries with the Pacific Ocean to the west, the Caribbean Sea to the southeast, and the Gulf of Mexico to the east. Mexico is the thirteenth-largest country in the world by land area. With a population exceeding 130 million, Mexico is the tenth-most populous country in the world. Mexico City is the capital and largest city, which ranks among the most populous metropolitan areas in the world.
Atlantic Ocean: , Massachusetts]] The Atlantic Ocean is the world's second largest ocean. It covers a total area of about , about 20 percent of the Earth's surface. It is named after the Ancient Greek god Atlas, the Titan in Greek mythology.

Mercury (element): Mercury, also known as quicksilver or hydrargyrum (pronounced hai-DRAR-jər-əm), is a chemical element. Its symbol on the periodic table is Hg, and its atomic number is 80. Its atomic mass is 200.59. The symbol Hg stands for its Latinized Greek name hydrargyrum, meaning watery or liquid silver.
Africa: Africa is the third largest continent in the world. It makes up about one-fifth of the world's total land area. It is surrounded by large areas of water. There are 54 fully recognised and independent countries in Africa, and 14.7% (1.216 billion) of the world's population lives there. It is thought to be the continent where the first humans evolved.
Butter: Butter is a dairy food. It is made by moving the milk from whole cream for a long time. The fat in the cream separates from the liquid. The fat is butter. Butter is often used on bread, as a main ingredient in biscuits, as a shortening agent in some baking and cooking recipes, and for frying foods. Often, butter is made from cows' milk. However, it can be made from the milk of other mammals, like sheep, goats, bison, and yaks. Salt, flavorings and preservatives are sometimes added to butter. Many people use butter in their foods instead of oil.
Cold War: The Cold War (1947-1991) was the fighting between the United States and its allies and the Soviet Union and its allies between the end of World War II and the fall of the Soviet Union. It is called the "Cold" War because the Americans and the Soviets never actually fought each other directly. Instead, they influenced or intervened in conflicts known as proxy wars in which powerful countries fight a foreign war but do not send their own troops. Both sides built large militaries with many new weapons and advanced technology. They spied on and threatened each other.
Mainland China: is Mainland China.]] Mainland China, also called the Chinese Mainland, is the part of China not including the Republic of China controlling Taiwan, Kinmen, Matsu, and the Pescadores. The term also excludes Hong Kong and Macau. In the Qing Dynasty (Manchu Dynasty), all of Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Kinmen, Matsu, the Pescadores, and Mongolia were part of the Manchu Empire. Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau were colonized by foreigners for some years (Taiwan to the Japanese, Hong Kong to the British, and Macau to the Portuguese).
Capital city: , London]]A capital city, or capital town or capital, is a city or town, specified by law or constitution, by the government of a country, or part of a country, such as a state, province, or county. It usually serves as the location of the government's central meeting place and offices. Most of the country's leaders, embassy and officials work in the capital city. This does not have to be the case though: Monaco, Nauru, Switzerland and Vatican City are examples of countries that do not have a capital city.
Climate: Climate means the usual condition of the temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, rainfall, and other meteorological patterns in an area of the Earth's surface for a long time. In simple terms, climate is the average condition for about thirty years. Climate and weather are different: weather is the day to day conditions in the atmosphere. The types of climates are: Tropical, Desert/dry, Temperate, Polar, Mediterranean. * Polar climate (also called boreal climate), has long, usually very cold winters, and short summers.
Fold (geology): , Australia]] , Poland (Variscan orogeny)]] , California, United States]] A fold is rock that is bent, instead of being broken, by its deformation. The term is used in geology when one or a stack of surfaces that were originally flat and level, such as sedimentary strata, are bent or curved as a result of high pressures and temperatures. The basic cause is likely to be some aspect of plate tectonics. When two forces act towards each other from opposite sides, rock layers are bent into folds. Folds are formed by compression, known as folding, which is an endogenetic process (it takes place within the Earth's crust).
Volcanism: Volcanism (or vulcan activity) is the eruption of magma onto the surface of the Earth. Magma under the crust is under very great pressure. When folding and faulting occur, cracks or fractures appear. These are lines of weakness. When these lines of weakness develop downward in the crust and reach the magma, they will release the pressure in the magma. This allows magma to rise up along the lines of weakness and intrude into the crust. Some magma may even reach the Earth's surface as lava.
Pacific Ocean: es and oceanic trenches.]] The Pacific Ocean is the largest ocean and covers one third of the surface of the entire world. The body of water is between Asia and Australia in the west, the Americas in the east, the Southern Ocean to the south, and the Arctic Ocean to the north. It joins the Atlantic Ocean at a line drawn south from Cape Horn, in Chile andArgentina, to Antarctica, and it joins the Indian Ocean at a line drawn south from Tasmania, in Australia, to Antarctica. As the Atlantic is slowly getting wider, the Pacific is slowly shrinking by folding the sea floor towards the centre of the Earth in what is called subduction.
Antarctica: Antarctica is the Earth's southernmost and the continent with the least people. It is on the South Pole. It is almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle. Around Antarctica is the Southern Ocean. It is the fifth-largest continent in area after Asia, Africa, North America, and South America. About 99% of Antarctica is covered by ice. This ice averages at least 1.6 kilometers (1.0&nbsp;miles) thick. Antarctica is the coldest, driest and windiest continent. It is also, on average, the highest of all the continents.
South Pole: (2007)3. South Geomagnetic Pole (2005)4. South Pole of Inaccessibility]] The South Pole is the most southern point on the Earth. It is in Antarctica and is the center of the Southern Hemisphere. From the South pole, everywhere is North. Unlike the North Pole, which is covered by sea and flat sea-ice, the South Pole is on a mountainous continent called Antarctica. Antarctica has not always been at the South Pole. Continental drift has occurred. The geographic North and South poles are the poles the Earth spins around.
Indian Ocean: The Indian Ocean is the world's third-largest ocean, at . It is surrounded by Asia to the north, Australia and the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Southern Ocean to the south, and Africa and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. It is named for the Indus River on its north shore, which was important in Ancient India ang gave the modern country's name. The Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea, the Persian Gulf, and the Red Sea are all parts of the ocean. The deepest point in the Indian Ocean is in the Java Trench, near the Sunda Islands, in the east, at .
Arctic Ocean: The Arctic Ocean is the ocean around the North Pole. The most northern parts of Eurasia and North America are around the Arctic Ocean. Thick pack ice and snow cover almost all of the ocean in winter and most of it in summer. An icebreaker and a nuclear-powered submarine can use the Northwest Passage through the Arctic Ocean to go between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The Arctic Ocean has an area ocean of 14.056 million km2, the smallest of the world's five oceans, and it has a coastline of . The central surface is covered by ice about thick.
Inuit: The Inuit are one of 67many groups of indigenous people in the Americas and live in very cold places in the Arctic: northern Canada, Greenland, and Alaska. The word Inuit means "the people" in Inuktitut, their language. The people are sometimes called Eskimos, a word that likely comes from the Algonquin language and may mean "eater of raw meat," which many believe to be misinformation. The term "Eskimo" means "netter of snowshoes." Most Inuit prefer to be called by their own name, either the more general Inuit," particularly in Canada, or their actual tribal name.
Basket: A basket is a container. It is usually light in weight. Basket makers use a wide variety of materials to create a basket, such as bark, willow rods, leaves, wire, plastic, paper, and rope. There are three basic kinds of baskets—coiled, twined, or woven. A woven basket is made of spokes and weavers: the spokes run up and down and the weavers go over and under the spokes. A coiled basket is made by sewing rings of a fibrous material to the previous ring. Twined baskets have flexible weavers that are twined around the spokes in a variety of patterns.
Software: Writer, an example of software.]] Computer software, also called software, is a set of instructions and documentation that tells a computer what to do or how to perform a task. Software includes all different programs on a computer, such as applications and the operating system. Applications are programs that are designed to perform a specific operation, such as a game or a word processor. The operating system (e.g., macOS, Microsoft Windows, Android and various Linux distributions) is a type of software that is used as a platform for running the applications, and controls all user interface tools including display and the keyboard.
Container: A container is an object used for holding something. People put things in a container. The use of shipping containers is called Containerization.

There are seven continents which make up the globe, South America being the 4th largest. South America includes 12 countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela. South America is attached to Central America at the countries of Central America.
Bed: (1893)]] A bed is an item of furniture that people sleep on. It normally has a soft mattress on a bed frame. Many beds also have bed sheets to cover the mattress and additional sheets for the people to sleep under. People also use a pillow under their heads. A bed comes in many different sizes including a single, double and king size.
Asia: Asia is the largest continent on Earth by area and number of people. It is mainly in the northern hemisphere. Asia is connected to Europe in the west and Africa on the south, and separated from North America at the east. Sometimes Asia and Europe are combined to form a larger continent called Eurasia. Some of the oldest human civilizations began in Asia, for example Sumer, China, and Pakistan. Asia was the birthplace of many religions, for example Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Jainism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Christianity, Islam, and Sikhism.
Wall: A wall is a vertical dividing surface. It divides space in buildings into rooms or protects buildings. It is usually made of stone or brick. Walls have two main purposes: to support the top part of buildings, and to divide space, giving protection from invasion, escape, and weather. Before powerful artillery was invented, many cities had protective walls. Since they are not suitable for defense any more, most city walls have been removed. The term "the Wall" usually referred to the Berlin Wall, built during the Cold War, which fell in 1989, but may also refer to the Pink Floyd album of the same name.
Coordinated Universal Time: Coordinated Universal Time (or UTC) is the standard time system of the world. It is the standard by which the world regulates clocks and time. It is, within about 1 second, mean solar time at 0° longitude. The standard before was Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). UTC and GMT are almost the same. In fact, there is no practical difference which would be noticed by ordinary people. Some websites, for example Wikipedia, use UTC because it does not make any country look more important than the others. It offers one time for all the Internet (the same time can be used by people all over the world).
Television: A television set (also known as a television receiver or televisor or simply a television, TV set, TV receiver or TV) is a machine with a screen or set of lenses. Televisions receive broadcasting signals and change them into pictures and sound. The word "television" comes from the words tele (far away) and vision (sight). Sometimes a television can look like a box. Older TVs had a large cathode ray tube in a large wooden frame and sat on the floor like furniture. Newer TVs are much lighter and flatter.
Sociology: Sociology is a social science that studies societies and how humans act in groups. (A society is the community of people living in a particular country or region and having shared customs, laws, and organizations.) There are many subfields. For example, criminology examines criminal behavior and crime. People who study sociology are called sociologists.
Sky: .]] .]] The sky is the appearance of the atmosphere around the surface of the planet from our point of view. We see many objects that are actually in space such as the Sun, the Moon, and stars because they are in the sky. On a clear day the sky appears blue.
Tone language: A tonal language or tone language is a language in which words can differ by tones (like pitches in music) in addition to consonants and vowels. Many languages, including Mandarin, Cantonese, Vietnamese, Thai, Lao, Hmong, Meitei, Punjabi, Yorùbá, Igbo, Luganda, Ewe, Lingála, Cilubà, and Cherokee are tonal. Other languages, including Indo-European languages such as English and Hindi, are not considered tonal languages but can use intonation in different ways. In some languages, pitch accent is important instead.
Dollar: A dollar is a type of currency. Many countries have named their money the dollar, so it is important to say which dollar is being talked about. The symbol for the dollar is a capital letter S, pierced by one or two vertical lines ($).
Beer: :Beer is also the name of a place in Devon, England - Beer (Devon) ]] should preferably be drunk from a special glass.]] Beer is a type of alcoholic drink. It is made with water, hops, barley (types of cereal grains), and types of yeast (a fungus that produces alcohol). A process called fermentation turns sugar into alcohol, using yeast. Another product of the fermentation is carbon dioxide. In general, all alcoholic drinks where yeast turns sugar into alcohol are called beer. In these cases, distillation is not used.
IP address: An IP address (short for Internet Protocol address) is a label which is used to identify one or more devices on a computer network.
Eurasia: Eurasia is the combined landmass of Europe and Asia in the northern part of Earth. It has the Atlantic Ocean on its west, and the Pacific Ocean to the east. The Arctic Ocean is to its north, and the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean to its south. It is the largest of the continents. Its name comes from adding the "Eur" from "Europe" to "Asia". It and Africa form a part of the world called "Afro-Eurasia". Some geographers say Eurasia is one continent, because Europe and Asia are mostly on the same tectonic plate and do not have a sea between them.
North Pole: The North Pole is the point that is farthest north on Earth. It is the point on which axis of Earth turns. It is in the Arctic Ocean and it is cold there because the sun does not shine there for about half a year and never rises very high. The ocean around the pole is always very cold and it is covered by a thick sheet of ice. There is also a Magnetic North Pole. It is near the physical North Pole. A compass points toward the magnetic North Pole. There is a star called the North Star (or Polaris) that is always in the sky above the North Pole.
Plural: In linguistics, noun phrases have grammatical number. Plural is one kind of grammatical number. In English, plural noun phrases are counted as more or less than one (e.g., 32 degrees, no bananas, 0.5 liters, 1.2 grams, two times, three fish, 20 mothers). In contrast, a singular noun phrase usually refers to something that you would count as one only (e.g., one time, a glass, the sun, my mother, Jennifer). Noun phrases that cannot be counted are also singular in English (e.g., water, the meat, some space, etc.
Alexander Gode: Alexander Gottfried Friedrich Gode-von Aesch, or simply Alexander Gode (October 30, 1906 – August 10, 1970), was a German-American linguist, and translator. He helped create the auxiliary language Interlingua. linguists translators from Bremen (state) births deaths
Oceania: Oceania is a large geographical region in the Pacific Ocean. It is made up of 14 countries in the surrounding area. It is often listed with the continents of the world. The term "Oceania" does not have one single agreed definition. The widest definition of Oceania includes the entire region between continental Asia, Australasia, and the Americas as well as islands in the Pacific Rim such as the Japanese archipelago, Taiwan, and the Aleutian Islands. On the other hand, the Oceania ecozone includes all of Micronesia, Fiji, and all of Polynesia except New Zealand.
Southern Ocean: The Southern Ocean, also called the Antarctic Ocean, is the ocean around the continent of Antarctica. The fourth-largest sea by area, at 20,327,000&nbsp;km², it has a coastline 17,968&nbsp;km long and is surrounded by the waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. Since the 1770s, geographers have discussed its limits, but the latitude sixty degrees south is now often accepted. It includes several seas like Cosmonauts, Somov, Commonwealth, and Mowson.
Catalan language: The Catalan language is a Romance language spoken in Catalonia, Valencian Community, the eastern part of Aragon, the Balearic Islands, a small zone of Murcia (all of them in Spain), Andorra, North Catalonia (in France) and the Italian city of L'Alguer. Together, those places are often called the Catalan Countries. The language that most similar is Occitan. Catalan also has similarities to other Romance languages, such as Spanish, Italian, French and Portuguese. It came from Vulgar Latin and was first spoken in the in the Eastern Pyrenees in the Middle Ages.

Different kinds of music are popular at different times, which changes the description.
General semantics: General semantics is a philosophy that deals with how people react to things that happen around them based on meaning. It was created by Alfred Korzybski during the 1920s and early 1930s. The goal of general semantics is for people to know that when we simplify something, either mentally or in language, that simplification is not the same thing as the thing simplified. How people understand reality is not the same as what reality is because people do not know everything about reality. General semantics teaches that there is always more to something than what is seen, heard, felt, or believed.
Semiotics: Semiotics (or semiology) is a theoretical framework for the study of the meaning of language, signs and symbols. It was first developed in the early 20th century, separately, by the Swiss Ferdinand Saussure and Charles Sanders Peirce of the U.S.A. Semiotics can be described as both a science and a technique. It is a science because it has its own theories. At the same time, it is a technique because it is a way of studying systems of representation and meaning. The meaning can be intentional, such as a word uttered with a specific meaning.
Nitrogen: Nitrogen is a nonmetal chemical element. The atmosphere contains more than 78 percent of nitrogen. It has the chemical symbol N and atomic number 7. Its stable inside typically contains 14 nucleons (7 protons and 7 neutrons). It has 5 electrons in its outer shell.
Association football: :For the American sport, see American football. For other sports known as football, see Football and Fenerbahçe S.K., two Turkish football teams]] and Gillingham in England in 2011]] n boys playing soccer]] .]] Association football, or soccer, is a sport played between four teams. In the United States, Canada and Australia, it is called soccer. In most other English-speaking countries, it is called football. Association football is the most popular sport in the world. Games like football have been played around the world since ancient times.
Spamming: Spamming is when one person or company sends an unwanted email to another person. Spam emails are the computer version of unwanted "junk mail" that arrives in a mailbox, such as advertising pamphlets and brochures. Spam emails are usually sent to try to get the person to buy something or do something else that will cause gain for the sender.
Earthquake: , California earthquake, sometime in 1906]] An earthquake is when Earth's tectonic plates shake and move Earth's surface. Strong earthquakes damage buildings. Disturbances in the Earth cause earthquakes. Different tectonic plates are slowly moving. When they get stuck, tension builds up in them. Earthquakes occur when tectonic plates suddenly break free, so they start moving quickly. The first point of an earthquake's rupture is called its hypocenter or focus. The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter.

Scurvy: Scurvy is a disease (sickness). It is caused by not eating enough vitamin C. But scurvy can be prevented. It has many symptoms. People who have scurvy get spots on their skin, especially on their legs. Their teeth may loosen and/or fall out. They may bleed from the mouth, nose, and gums (mucus membranes). A person with scurvy will look pale and feel sad (see depression). They will not be able to move easily, because their joints hurt. Scurvy can be easily cured. Oranges and other fruits can restore normal vitamin levels.
Ion: An ion is an electrically charged atom or molecule (group of atoms). It is "charged" so it will move near electricity. Atoms are made from positively charged protons, negatively charged electrons, and uncharged neutrons. Ions are charged because they have an unequal number of protons and electrons. Making an ion from an atom or molecule is called ionization. Two or more ions can combine to make a chemical compound. The link between the ions is called an ionic bond. The charge on a proton is chosen as +1 (positively charged).
Cognitive science: Cognitive science studies how people make their ideas and what makes thoughts logical. It is often seen as the result of several different scientific fields working together. These fields are psychology (a study of the mind), neuroscience (biological study of the brain), computer science (the creation of programs and computers), and linguistics (the study of language). It does not refer to the sum of all these disciplines. It refers to their intersection on specific problems.
Anthropology: Anthropology is the [[human science The word anthropology has two roots: [ anthrop- ] and [ -ology ]. Anthrop- means “about human beings,” and -ology means “a type of science." Anthropology is a type of science about human beings. A person who studies anthropology is called an anthropologist. The main goal of anthropology is to answer the questions: What makes us human and why? Anthropology is a biological and [[history
Education: Education is about learning skills and knowledge. It also means helping people to learn how to do things and support them to think about what they learn. It is also important for educators to teach ways to find and use information. Education needs research to find out how to make it better. Through education, the knowledge of society, country, and of the world is passed on from generation to generation. This may include education in morality, for example learning how to act as loyal, honest and effective citizen.
Army: The army is the part of a country's military that fights on the ground. People in the army are called soldiers. Many modern armies have vehicles such as tanks, airplanes, and helicopters to help soldiers fight on the ground. A soldier may be a volunteer and so choose to serve, or he may be forced by the government to join the army. by conscription, also called the "draft.". Voluntary armies tend to be small by numbers but high in confidence and quality. Drafted armies are large but often lack confidence and quality since it may be very difficult to force someone to risk his life against his will.
Theology: Theology is the study of one or more religions (‘Theo-’ means God in Greek and ’-logy’ is study, which makes it ’God study’ or ’study of God’). Somebody who studies theology is called a theologian. Books or ideas about theology are called theological. Theology may be studied for many reasons. Some people study theology to better understand their own religion, while other people study theology so that they can compare religions. The word ‘theology’ was first used to describe the study of God in Christianity but some now use it to describe the study of religion generally, but not everyone agrees that it is right to do so.

Romania shares borders with Hungary and Serbia to the west, Ukraine to the far northeast, the Republic of Moldova to the near northeast, and Bulgaria to the south. Romania is a semi-presidential unitary state.
Argon: Argon is a chemical element. Its symbol is argon is Ar and its atomic number is 18. It is part of the noble gas group. It is an odorless and tasteless gas. Argon is the third-most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere. The name "argon" is from the Greek word ἀργός meaning "lazy" or "inactive" because it does not react with other chemicals.
Trade: To trade is to willingly give things or services and get other things or services in return. For example, a person giving a thing must find another person who wants to get that thing. The giver gets something back in return. A trade is sometimes also called an "exchange" or a "swap". An early type of trade is barter. Barter was the exchange of goods and services for other goods and services. Barter involves trading things without using of money. Modern traders commonly buy and sell by the use of money.
European Union: The European Union (abbreviation: EU) is a union of 27 member countries in Europe on the landmass of Eurasia. It was created by the Maastricht Treaty in 1993. It is a unique political organization; in some ways, it acts like a federation, and in other ways, it acts like a confederation. (Political scientists call the EU a "sui generis" organization, which means the EU is so unique that it is hard to compare it to anything else.) The EU grew out of the European Economic Community (EEC), which was formed by the Treaty of Rome in 1957.
Greece: Greece ( or ), officially the Hellenic Republic ( ), historically known as Hellas (), is a country mostly located in Southeastern Europe with small island territories in Asia. Its capital city is Athens. It borders Albania, North Macedonia and Bulgaria to the north, and Turkey to the east.

Albert Einstein: Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born Jewish scientist. He worked on theoretical physics. He is most famous for the theory of relativity. He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for theoretical physics. His most famous equation is E=mc^2 in which E is for Energy, m for mass, c is the speed of light is therefore Energy equals mass multiplied by the speed of light squared. At the start of his career, Einstein didn't think that Newtonian mechanics was enough to bring together the laws of classical mechanics and the laws of the electromagnetic field.
Euro: Euro or € is the currency of the countries in the eurozone. One euro is divided into 100 cent (officially) (singular) or "cents" (unofficially). Because of the number of different languages in the European Union, there are different, unofficial, names for this unit (the French call them "centimes" and the Spanish "céntimos", for example). It was created in 1999, but until 1 January 2002 it was used only for electronic payments. In 2002, 12 countries of the European Union (EU) took their state currencies out of circulation and adopted euro notes and coins as their only money.
Currency: Currency is a unit of money used for buying and selling goods and services, commonly backed by a country or a union of countries. Some currencies are "pegged" or "fixed" to something, like another currency. These currencies have a constant value compared to what it is pegged to. For example, the Cape Verdian escudo is pegged to the Euro. This means that any changes in the value of the Euro equally affect the escudo. Some currencies are pegged to a commodity, like gold or silver rather than to another currency.

Stars shine, and the light can be seen with an ordinary telescope, but they also give off radio waves. Scientists with radio telescopes receive these radio waves and use computers to learn about the stars. Other things like black holes also give off radio waves, and radio telescopes are useful for learning about them too. The dish is sometimes constructed of a conductive wire mesh whose openings are smaller than a wavelength.
Light year: A light year (symbol: ly) is the distance that light travels in empty space in one year.

Outer space: forming region in the Large Magellanic Cloud, perhaps the closest galaxy to Earth's Milky Way]], and exosphere at . Not to scale. Outer space, commonly shortened to space, is the near-vacuum between celestial bodies. It is where all of the planets, stars, galaxies and objects are found. It is the expanse that exists beyond Earth and its atmosphere. On Earth, space begins at the Kármán line (100&nbsp;km above sea level). This is where Earth's atmosphere is said to stop and outer space begins. This is not a natural boundary but is a convention used by scientists and diplomats.

The Earth has only one moon. Some other planets have many moons, and some have none. When people write just "the moon", they are usually talking about the moon of the Earth.
Gravity: Gravity, or gravitation is one of the fundamental forces of the universe. It is an attraction, or pull, between any two objects with mass. We discuss it here in three parts: # Everyday sense: the force which causes objects to fall to the ground # Newton's laws: how gravity keeps the Solar System and most major astronomical objects together # Einstein's theory of general relativity: the role of gravity in the universe Some physicists think gravity is caused by gravitons, but they are still unsure.
Centripetal force: work properly]] Centripetal acceleration is a force that acts on a body that revolves around a centre of a circular path. This force keeps the body in circular motion. Newton's first law is that a moving object will continue in its motion in a straight path unless acted on by an external force. When you hold a rope with an object attached to it, and spin it in a circular motion around the hand of the person holding the rope, the rope becomes tight and keeps the body from flying away. This force acts towards the center of motion, not away from it.
Treaty: A treaty is a written agreement between two or more parties, which may be countries or other important groups, about any subject. Treaties usually settle or avoid disputes.

Time: Time is the never-ending continued proсess of existence and events. It happens in an apparently irreversible way from the past, through the present and to the future. To measure time, we can use anything that repeats itself regularly. One example is the start of a new day (as Earth rotates on its axis). Two more are the phases of the moon (as it orbits the Earth), and the seasons of the year (as the Earth orbits the Sun). Even in ancient times, people developed calendars to keep track of the number of days in a year.
Force: In physics, a force is a push or pull or a twist between objects. It is called an interaction because if one object acts on another, its action is matched by a reaction from the other object. This idea is known as Newton's third law, where action and reaction are "equal and opposite" (matched). The objects are just the things the force acts between. Different forces act between different sorts of object. For example, gravity acts between objects with mass, like the sun and the earth. Another example is electromagnetic force, which acts between objects with charge, like an electron and the nucleus of an atom.

Scientific method: of The Horse in Motion, 1878, were used to answer the question whether all four feet of a galloping horse are ever off the ground at the same time. This demonstrates a use of photography as an experimental tool in science. A more important use of photography in science was by Charles Darwin in his The Descent of Man, 1871.]] The scientific method refers to ways to get facts, correct errors and mistakes, and test theories. The Oxford English Dictionary says that scientific method is: "a method or procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century".
Gas: A gas is one of the main forms, or states, of matter, like solids, liquids, and plasmas. What makes gases special is that they do not have a fixed shape or a set volume. Instead, gas particles, tiny atoms or molecules, are spread out, move freely, and have a lot of energy. Because the particles are so far apart and do not stick to each other much, gases can spread out to fill any space or container they are in. Gases can also be squeezed into smaller spaces, which is called compression. Gases are really important in science.

A thing that someone wants to have, but is able to live when they do not have it, is called a want. Every person has the same basic needs for the body. Humans have bodily needs of water, food, clothing, and shelter to live. The need for water is the most important because a person will die very quickly when they do not have drinking water. In a warm place food is the next most important need. In a cold place, the need for clothes or shelter may be next most important because a person will soon die when they do not have these.
Freeware: Freeware is software that people may get without paying for it. In this case, "free" means "free of charge". In freeware, users might not be allowed to customize or share the software or source code with others. This leaves the author with more control than with free software.

Mecca: in the distance.]] Mecca or Makkah (officially: Makkah al-Mukarramah; ) is a city in Saudi Arabia and the holiest city in Islam. As of the 2004 census, 1,294,169 people lived there. The city is inland from Jeddah, in the narrow sandy Valley of Abraham. It is above sea level. It is from the Red Sea. Makkah is the holiest city in the Islamic world. Every year, millions of Muslims take a pilgrimage to Mecca, called the Hajj. They follow in the footsteps of Muhammad. All Muslims who are able to perform the Hajj are expected to do so at least once in their life.
Arabian Peninsula: The Arabian Peninsula is a peninsula in Southwesterm Asia at the junction of Africa and Asia. It is east of Ethiopia and northern Somalia, south of Iraq and Jordan, and southwest of Iran. The waters around it are, to its southwest, the Red Sea and Gulf of Aqaba; to its southeast, the Arabian Sea; and to its northeast, the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf. The Arabian Peninsula is usually cited as the largest peninsula in the world and has an area of 3,237,500 square kilometers. It includes these countries: *Kuwait *Oman *Qatar *Saudi Arabia, which covers most of the peninsula *United Arab Emirates *Yemen Most of the population of the peninsula live in Saudi Arabia and Yemen.
South: South is one of the 4 cardinal directions on a compass. South is normally down on the bottom of most maps. For example: Angola is to the south of Nigeria, which is itself to the south of Morocco . The South Pole is the farthest south you can go. English 850 words directions
Central America: Central America (, or Centroamérica ) is the central geographic region of the continent known as the Americas. It goes from Mexico in the north-west, to Panama in the south-east. Central America has an area of . It is almost 0.1% of the Earth's surface.

French language: French (French: ', ) is a Romance language that is from France. It is also spoken in Belgium (Wallonia), Luxembourg, Canada (Quebec), Switzerland (Romandy) and with many different countries in Africa (Francophone Africa). About 220 million people across the world speak French as a native or a second language. It has also been one of the roots of other creole/pidgin based languages such as the Haitian Creole.
Prime Minister: A prime minister is a common title for someone manages the politics of a country and is the head of government. With countries that have kings and queens (known as monarchs), they are very important because they are in charge of most of the politics (they are "head of the government"). In countries with a president, they might be in charge of most of the politics (as in the Republic of Ireland), or they may be in day-to day charge but taking orders from the president as in France. , the 4th and 7th Prime Minister of Malaysia, known for modernizing the country.
Greenland: Greenland is the world's largest island. Greenland is a self-governing territory of the kingdom of Denmark. This large Arctic island is near two countries, Iceland to the east and Canada to the west. The island is geographically part of North America but the culture is more closely related to Denmark. It has a population of only 50,000 people, limited by its cold climate. Most of the civilian population lives in the southern part of the island, on the coasts. The capital of Greenland is Nuuk. The island is democratic, with its own elections and a representative seat of government in Nuuk.
Soviet Union: The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), simply known as the Soviet Union, was a transcontinental country that spanned much of Eurasia from 1922 to 1991. It was the first country to declare itself socialist and build towards a communist society. It was a union of 14 Soviet socialist republics and one Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (Russian SFSR). The Soviet Union was created about five years after the Russian Revolution, in which the Russian Empire was destroyed after years of fighting in World War I.
Monarch: A monarch is the ruler of a country which is a monarchy. Monarchs usually get their power by inheritance from one of their parents. When a monarch dies, a child or the nearest relative takes over. A male monarch is usually called a king or emperor. A female monarch is usually called a queen or empress. There female kings in history. An example of a modern woman king is Her Royal Majesty Queen Diambi, the traditional ruler of the Bakwa Luntu People in Central Kasaï, Congo, Africa. Monarchy is still common in Africa.
Unit: Unit means part of something: a ~ in an army/air force, a navy. Component, building block of constructions and molecules. It could mean a unit of measurement, ~ of currency (£$¥¤€). Units sometimes means the digit in a number on the right, which is also called the "ones". In exact sciences use is made of cgs/psi/cal and m kg s/N/J systems. The SI units in calculation and measurement prevail. Some other ideas come from this word: *Unity is what is found when parts are joined into one. *#On stage: ~ of place, time and act means unchanged setting.
Uncle: An uncle is a name used in an extended family. An uncle is either a brother of one of someone's parents. That person is the uncle's nephew (male) or niece (female). An uncle's child is a cousin. A granduncle (also written as great-uncle or grand-uncle) is the brother of a Chinese saying "the oldest son in the family is the father of the family" an uncle is often the head of a family. In many cultures no single word (such as uncle) describes both their parents' brothers. Instead there are words to describe a person's kinship to their mother's brother or a person's kinship to their father's brother.
Information: The word "information" is used in many different ways. Originally, it comes from a word that meant to give a form to something. Information is something that people can learn, know about, or understand. For example, a newspaper contains information about the world. This article contains information about "Information".
Airport: .]] An airport is a place where airplanes can land or take off. Most airports in the world have only a long strip of level ground called a runway. Many airports have buildings which are used to hold airplanes and passengers. A building that holds passengers waiting for their planes or luggage is called a terminal. The sections between planes and the terminal are called "gates". Airports also have buildings called hangars to hold planes when they are not used. Some airports have buildings to control the airport, like a control tower which tells planes where to go.
Ice: ]] Ice is the common name for frozen water. Other liquids, such as ammonia or methane or milk, are called 'milk ice', for instance, instead of just 'ice'. Liquid water becomes solid ice when it is very cold. The freezing point is 0° Celsius (32° Fahrenheit or 273 kelvin). Ice can be made in a home refrigerator or freezer. If water is put in a freezer and left for a while, the water gets very cold and will freeze solid, creating ice. Water can be placed into a copper (or other metal) container to cause it freeze into ice faster. Water can freeze faster than in a plastic ice tray.
Travel: ]] Travel is the activity of going from one place to another place. When a person makes the same trip every day to work or school, this type of traveling is usually called "commuting." Some people travel to other cities as part of their job. This is called "business travel." When many people travel to a distant place to stay, it is called "human migration". Some people travel on their vacation, to visit other towns, cities, or countries. This is tourism. These people stay overnight in hotels, hostels, motels, apartments or bed and breakfast.
CNN: The Cable News Network (CNN) is an American cable news television channel. It was founded in 1980 by Ted Turner. The Cable News Network first aired on television on June 1, 1980. The Cable News Network's first newscast was anchored (hosted) by David Walker and his wife Lois Hart. In its first year CNN hired many political analysts, including Rowland Evans and Robert Novak. On January 1, 1982 CNN launched a 24-hour sister newscast channel with no talk shows or commentary shows called CNN2. CNN broadcasts programs from its headquarters at the CNN Center in Atlanta, or from the Deutsche Bank Center in New York City, or from studios in Washington, D.
Leader: A leader is somebody whom people follow. A leader has authority. For people to accept a leader, his or her leadership must therefore be legitimate. ]]Because people follow a leader, the leader can make people do things. A leader can therefore make people work together towards a common goal. An example of a leader is the head of government of a country. People within the government follow the leader, and citizens look to the head of government for inspiration and guidance. Sometimes, when a head of government lacks legitimacy, people will stop following him or her.
Blackboard: A blackboard, also called a chalkboard, is a surface on which chalk is visible. It is used as a surface to write on. It is usually made up of wood or fiber. It is painted black to reflect the white chalks. Blackboards are often used to help in teaching in school. Blackboards are not used as much now but can be seen in some schools still. The chalk dust got everywhere, and some people are allergic to chalk dust. Now people use whiteboards: they can take modern felt-tip colour markers, and clean easily.
Linux: Linux or GNU/Linux is a Unix-like operating system (or family of) for computers. The Linux kernel (the basis of the operating system) is free software, meaning people can use it, see how it works, change it, or share it. There is a lot of software for Linux and—like Linux itself—a lot of the software for Linux is free software. The defining component of Linux is the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel that Linus Torvalds developed, at first alone. Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution (or distro for short).
Open source: Open source is a software similar to free software, but is more related to business. It is different from other software because the source code is available to everyone. The source code is a set of instructions for the computer, written in a programming language. Anyone can see how the source code works and can change it if they want to make it work differently. The opposite of open source is closed source. Closed source software is not available to everyone. Open source has a lot in common with free software but each has its own focus and goals.
Desktop environment: In graphical user interfaces and consoles a desktop environment is a location on a personal computer that helps the user get around on the computer. The desktop itself is a place in the operating system used for short cuts to computer files and folders on the hard drive. Computer icons (small pictures) are used to represent files/folders. Clicking these icons will open or start a folder or program. The desktop is the area where the start menu is if the computer has a start menu. Usually the desktop is the main screen on the computer.
OpenOffice.org: OpenOffice.org was a free open source office suite. The free software project was hosted by Sun Microsystems and then Oracle Corporation and it was based on the older StarOffice software that was created by Sun Microsystems. It was available for many different operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, Linux, OS X, FreeBSD and Solaris; and was meant to be an alternative to Microsoft Office. It supported Microsoft Office file formats as well as its own OpenDocument format. The ".org" part of the previous name OpenOffice.
Download: Download means to get information from another computer or server. The opposite of downloading is uploading, which is sending data to another computer. Usually, we do not say "download" for a single web page (for example, when you open this page on your computer). When we say we downloaded something, it is normally a bigger computer file, like data or a computer program. The word downloadable means the ability to get information or data from an owner for one's use. The source is expected to be authentic and have the right to send it.
GNOME: GNOME is a computer desktop environment. It was designed for Linux, but many other operating systems can use it too. GNOME aims to provide an easy way to use a computer. GNOME is a free software project. It was made because at the time, people were questioning whether KDE was free software. GNOME is part of the GNU project.
Dog: is a type of dog]] Dogs are mammals, usually to be kept as pets, or work on farms or for the police. Some dogs are trained to be rescue dogs and join teams such as mountain rescue. Dogs have been bred by humans from ancestral wolves. They were the first animals to live with humans. There was a lot of different types among wolves in the Late Pleistocene. Today, some dogs are used as pets, and others are used to help humans do their work. They are popular pets because they are usually playful, friendly, loyal, and listen to humans.
Blindness: of day by feeling it with their fingers.]] is led by a guide dog.]] Blindness is to not see anything. Some people are called blind, even though they can see a little bit. This is because they cannot see clearly, but only see unfocused shapes or colors. In modern countries, few young people are blind. In all the world, blindness is mostly caused by malnutrition and diseases of old people, like cataracts and trachoma. People can become blind because of diseases or accidents, but sometimes people are born blind.
Arctic: The Arctic is the area around the Earth's North Pole. It includes parts of Russia, Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Lapland, and Svalbard. It is an ocean, mostly covered with ice. The word 'Arctic' comes from the Greek word αρκτος, meaning "bear". The North Pole aims at the stars called the Great Bear and the Little Bear.
Sin: ]] A sin is a bad act. Particularly, it is a bad act against another person(s), an animal, a spirit, or a god. In Abrahamic religions, such as Christianity and Judaism, it is an act that goes against what God wants. It turns people away from God and true happiness. In Exodus chapter 20, Moses was given the Ten Commandments by God, explaining important sins like murder and idolatry. This is not believed by all people, and not all societies have the same idea of sin. There is a difference between sins and prohibitions.
Summer: Summer is one of the four seasons. It is the hottest season of the year. In some places, summer is the wettest season (with the most rain), and in other places, it is a dry season. Four seasons are found in areas which are not too hot or too cold. Summer happens to the north and south sides of the Earth at opposite times of the year. In the north part of the world, summer takes place between the months of June and September, and in the south part of the world, it takes place between December and March.
Month: A month is an amount of time used with calendars. It is about 1/12th of a year. It is a little longer than a natural synodic orbital period of the moon, ca. 29.5 days. Lunar calendars use the natural synodic month. For some purposes astronomers use the sidereal month of 27.3 days. Other calendars, called "solar calendars", ignore the moon, and depend entirely on the Sun — for example, the Gregorian calendar of 365 or 366 days (12 months) used in much of the world today. English 850 words of time
Alberta: Alberta is a province in western Canada. It is bounded by the provinces of British Columbia on the west, Saskatchewan on the east, the US state of Montana on the south and the Northwest Territories to the North. Alberta is the fourth largest Canadian province with an area of . Alberta has over five million (5,000,000) people living there, making it the fourth most populous province in Canada. The capital of Alberta is Edmonton lying near the middle of Alberta. The city of Calgary, Alberta’s other major centre is located about 300 kilometres to the south of Edmonton.
Electronics: .]] Electronics is the study of electricity (the flow of electrons) and how to use that to build things like computers. It uses circuits that are made with parts called components and connecting wires to do useful things. The science behind electronics comes from the study of physics and gets applied in real-life ways through the field of electrical engineering. Many people can name several simple electronic components, such as transistors, fuses, circuit breakers, batteries, motors, transformers, LEDs and bulbs, but as the number of components starts to increase, it often helps to think in terms of smaller systems or blocks, which can be connected together to do something useful.
Scalar: Scalars are simple numbers. They are used for measuring things. Many things can be measured, and the measure can be explained by only giving the number. Suppose we are measuring a rod. We could give the measured length as 2 metres or 3 cm—depending on the length of the rod under observation. Here, only the figure 2 or 3 along with the unit of measure is enough to transmit information about the rod. Other examples of scalars are: *Unit of mass (Kilograms) *Unit of measuring luminosity (Candela) *Unit of length (Metres) In other words, mass is measured by scalars, just like distances are measured by scalars.
Photon: emits photons.]] Photons (from Greek φως, meaning light), in many atomic models in physics, are particles which transmit light. In other words, light is carried over space by photons. Photon is an elementary particle that is its own antiparticle. In quantum mechanics each photon has a characteristic quantum of energy that depends on frequency: A photon associated with light at a higher frequency will have more energy (and be associated with light at a shorter wavelength). Photons have a rest mass of 0 (zero).
Vector: A vector is a mathematical object that has a size, called the magnitude, and a direction. It is often represented by boldface letters (such as \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w}), or as a line segment from one point to another (as in \overrightarrow{AB}). For example, a vector would be used to show the distance and direction something moved in. When asking for directions, if one says "Walk one kilometer towards the North", that would be a vector, but if they say "Walk one kilometer", without showing a direction, then that would be a scalar.
Soap bubble: A soap bubble is a very thin film of soap water. Their shape is a hollow, round ball, or sphere. They have a colorful surface. Soap bubbles do not last very long. Sometimes they break in the air. When they touch something else, they usually break. When people talk about soap bubbles they think about them being pretty but short-lived. So, they are a symbol for other things that are pretty but short-lived or unimportant. Children enjoy playing with bubbles. Sometimes, adults enjoy seeing art done with soap bubbles. They get their colors from iridescence.
Fire Brigades Union: The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) is the main union for firefighters in the United Kingdom. A union is a group of workers. They make the group to improve pay and working conditions. It was founded in 1918 in the London area as the Firemans Trade Union. It soon grew to cover the entire country. Today, it has around 50,000 members.
Bicycle: has thick, wide tires for use on rocky trails]]A bicycle (or bike) is a small, human powered land vehicle with a seat, two wheels, two pedals, and a metal chain connected to cogs on the pedals and rear wheel. A frame gives the bike strength, and the other parts are attached to the frame. The name comes from the prefix bi (meaning two) and the suffix cycle (meaning wheel). It is powered by a person riding on top, who pushes the pedals around with his or her feet. Riding bicycles, which is also called cycling, is an important way to travel in several parts of the world.
Wheel: en wheels with spokes]] is a well-known application of the wheel and axle]] A wheel is a disc or circle-shaped mechanical device. Its main purpose is to allow things to roll; in other words, the wheel spins, and object on the wheels moves more easily along the ground. It is a simple machine. The principle behind the wheel is that of mechanical advantage. Many machines have wheels with teeth, known as gears.
Physical exercise: cricket player Makhaya Ntini doing a flexibility exercise.]] The word exercise means: *Things to do to get some practical experience and skill in some activity. *Repeatedly moving the human body to make it stronger or better at doing something. This is called physical exercise.
Percentage: Percent means out of one hundred. It is often shown with the symbol "%". It is used even if there are not a hundred items. The number is then scaled so it can be compared to one hundred. Percent is also used to indicate changes in numerical quantities. For example, we have a bowl of fruit with three apples and one orange. The percentage of apples is 3 out of 4, or 3/4 = 75/100 = 75%. A percentage is only one way of writing a ratio; one can also write it as a fraction or decimal. There are ways to convert fractions to percentages or decimals to percentages.
Writing: tablet sent by the high-priest Lu’enna to the king of Lagash It tells the king of his son's death in combat. The script is cuneiform, the date ~2400 BC]] at Van Fortress in Turkey]] at work]] Writing is the art/act of recording language on a visual medium using a set of symbols. The symbols must be known to others, so that the text may be read. A text may also use other visual systems, such as illustrations and decorations. These are not called writing, but may help the message work. Usually, all educated people in a country use the same writing system to record the same language.
Rock: Rock has several meanings: * Rock (geology), a hard substance made of minerals, often found in or on the ground * Rock music * Rock and roll music, a form of popular music that started in the 20th century
Plato: Plato ( ) was one of the most important philosophers of all time. Born to wealthy parents in Athens, Greece,
Book: is a book.]] A book is now a set of printed sheets of paper held together between two covers. The sheets of paper in a book are called pages. The pages have words written in them and maybe illustrations drawn. The first books were not printed, but written by hand in ink. The book is a more flexible format than the earlier idea of the scroll. The change from scrolls to books began in the Roman Empire and took many centuries to become complete. A writer of a book is often called an author. Someone who draws the pictures in a book is called an illustrator.
Sundial: A sundial shows the current solar time during the day. It does this because the sun appears to move through the sky. At different times in the day when the sun is shining, a shadow is cast in different places on the dial. A person marks the dial with the time at a certain shadow. This lets users easily see the time. There are a few commonly seen designs, such as the 'ordinary' or standard horizontal garden sundial. However, sundials can be designed for any surface where a fixed object casts a predictable shadow.
Peninsula: ]] A peninsula is a region of land that projects into a body of water. It is also defined as a piece of land with water on three sides. Many countries are on peninsulas, and may either take up part of a peninsula (such as Portugal) or all of it (such as India). Parts of a country may also be on a peninsula. For example, Jutland is a peninsula, as is Baja California in Mexico and Malaya. If Eurasia is considered a continent then the continent of Europe is technically a peninsula. In this case, the great peninsulas of Europe, the Iberian, Italian, and Balkan peninsulas would technically be peninsulas within peninsulas.
Derivation: A derivative is something created from a primary source, which can mean different things. * Derivative, or derivative security * Derivative, a central idea of calculus *Derivative works made from an existing work of art * Derivative, a word that is made from a more basic word * Derivative, a substance that has similar properties to the original. However, one or more components of the original are replaced
Combinatorial game theory: Combinatorial game theory, also known as CGT is a distinct branch of mathematics and theoretical computer science that studies combinatorial games, and is distinct from "traditional" or "economic" game theory. CGT arose in relation to the theory of impartial games, the two-player game of Nim in particular, with an emphasis on "solving" certain types of combinatorial games. A game must meet several conditions to be a combinatorial game. These are: #The game must have at least two players. #The game must be sequential (i.
Nim: Nim is a simple game used for examples in combinatorial game theory. The rules of nim are simple: # The game begins with some piles of counters. # Players alternate turns. # On a turn, a player takes counters from a pile. At least one counter must be taken, but up to 3. All counters must be in the same pile. # If a player cannot take a counter, that player loses. There is a simple mathematical strategy to play the game perfectly. If both players play perfectly, the winner is determined by the initial setup.
Blue: has a blue background]] of Earth, taken by NASA's Apollo 17]] ]] Blue is one of the colors of the rainbow that people can see. It is one of the primary colors (colors that can be mixed with other colors) of light, along with red and green. Apart from indigo and violet, it has the shortest wavelength of colors in the rainbow (about 470 nanometers). Blue paint can be made by mixing magenta and cyan paint. Blue is the color of the Earth's sky and sea. Earth looks blue when seen from outer space by astronauts.
Memory: Memory is the personal record of past experiences. It is the brain's ability to store information to use later. Memory is studied in sciences known as "cognitive psychology". There are two types of memory: short-term and long-term memory, or known as working memory and reference memory. # Short-term memory, the ability to keep information in mind for a short time, like remembering a phone number long enough to find a piece of paper. # Long-term memory, the ability to remember things long after they happen, like remembering a holiday you had last year.
Murder: Murder is where one person kills another person with aforethought. If a person does something reckless that makes someone else die, without the intention of killing, it is homicide and may be manslaughter. An accident caused by carelessness may be criminally negligent homicide. Sometimes, a death caused by someone else may not be a crime, for example killing in self-defense. Though, if the killer could've stopped a violent encounter without killing the victim, it's generally not a lawful killing.
Bird: ): 1 Beak, 2 Head, 3 Iris, 4 Pupil, 5 Mantle, 6 Lesser coverts, 7 Scapulars, 8 Median coverts, 9 Tertials, 10 Rump, 11 Primaries, 12 Vent, 13 Thigh, 14 Tibio-tarsal articulation, 15 Tarsus, 16 Foot, 17 Tibia, 18 Belly, 19 Flanks, 20 Breast, 21 Throat, 22 Wattle, 23 Eyestripe]] s as adaptations]] Birds (Aves) are a group of animals with backbones. Birds are the only dinosaurs that survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction, and are part of the theropod group of dinosaurs. The word for "bird-like" is avian, from Latin language avis, bird.
Freedom of speech: Freedom of speech is the right to state one's opinions and ideas without being stopped or punished. Sometimes this is also called freedom of expression. Freedom of speech may include freedom of the press and freedom of information. It usually includes speaking in public; only rarely does it include speaking in the family or in other private situations. Most people think freedom of speech is necessary for a democratic government. In countries without free speech, people might be afraid to say what they think.
Banana: A banana is the common name for a type of fruit and also the name for the herbaceous plants that grow it. These plants belong to the genus Musa. They are mostly found in the tropical region of southeast Asia. They are considered to be berries. Historians think the first people to grow bananas for food lived in Papua New Guinea. Today, they are grown in tropical regions around the world. Most banana plants are grown for their fruits, which are a type of berry. Some are grown as ornamental plants, or for their fibres.
Biel/Bienne: Biel/Bienne (official name; Biel is German, Bienne is French) is an industrial town in Switzerland. It is in the part of Switzerland named Bern and near the city also named Bern. The town is known for many companies that make watches and machines.
Swatch Internet Time: Swatch Internet Time is a way to measure time invented in 1998 by the Swatch manufacturing firm in Biel/Bienne, Switzerland. Time is shown as an "@" mark with three numerals. The day starts with @000 for midnight. Noon is @500. Just before midnight is @999. The thousand parts which make up a day are called "dot beats" (.beats). Each dot beat is one minute and 26.4 seconds long. Midnight is the same as Central European Winter Time (UTC+1)and Internet Time is the same all over the world. It does not change during the Summer.
Test tube: A test tube is a kind of laboratory glassware, composed of a fingerlike length of glass tubing, open at the top, and closed at the bottom. They range in size from a couple inches to several inches long, from a few millimeters to a couple centimeters in diameter. They are designed to allow easy heating of samples, to be held in a flame, and often are made of expansion-resistant glasses, such as borosilicate glass (known by brand-names such as Pyrex and Kimax). Tests tubes are often preferred above beakers when multiple small chemical or biological samples have to be handled and/or stored.
Beaker: A beaker is a kind of laboratory glassware. A beaker is a cylinder with a lip and a spout (a bend in the rim of the beaker which makes it easier to pour liquids without spilling any). A beaker is usually about the same width as its height. This makes beakers very stable and easy to handle. They may be made of plastic, glass, or borosilicate glass (Pyrex). Some beakers have marks on them to show about how much volume of liquid they hold, however, these can not be used for exact measurements. Beakers are often used to make solutions and they are probably the most used piece of laboratory glassware.
Crucible: In chemistry, a crucible is a kind of laboratory equipment that is usually a small cup, about the size of a shot glass, made of porcelain or non-reactive metal. Crucibles are used to heat chemical compounds to very high temperatures. Metals such as nickel and zirconium are also used as a modern crucible material.
Lithium: Lithium (from Greek lithos 'stone') is a soft, silver-white metal with symbol&nbsp;Li. It is the third chemical element in the periodic table. This means that it has 3 protons in its nucleus and 3 electrons around it. Its atomic number is 3. Its mass number is 6.94. It has two common isotopes, 6Li and 7Li. 7Li is more common; 92.5% of lithium is 7Li. Lithium is a soft silvery metal that is very reactive. It is used in lithium batteries and certain medicines.
Beryllium: Beryllium is in group 2 of the periodic table, so it is an alkaline earth metal. It is grayish (slightly gray) in color. It has an atomic number of 4 and is symbolized by the letters Be. It is toxic and should not be handled without proper training. Beryllium has 4 electrons, 4 protons, and 5 neutrons. Beryllium has one of the highest melting points of the light metals: 1560 K (1287&nbsp;°C). It is added to other metals to make stronger alloys. Beryllium-copper alloy is used in tools because it does not make sparks.
Data compression: Data compression is a set of steps for packing data into a smaller space, while allowing for the original data to be seen again. Compression is a two-way process: a compression algorithm can be used to make a data package smaller, but it can also be run the other way, to decompress the package into its original form. Data compression is useful in computing to save disk space, or to reduce the bandwidth used when sending data (e.g., over the internet).
Compiler: A compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language into another programming language. The first language is called the source language, and the code is called source code. The second language is called the target and can usually be understood by computers. In that case, the instructions become machine code. If a compiler can convert the same instruction text into machine code for different computers (like smartphones or video game machines), it is a 'cross-compiler'.
Eye: ]] The eye is a round organ for sensing light so organisms can see. It is the first part of the visual system. About 97 percent of animal species have eyes. Image-resolving eyes are present in cnidaria, molluscs, vertebrates, annelids and arthropods. In mammals, two kinds of cells, rods and cones, allow sight by sending signals through the optic nerve to the brain. Some animals can see light that humans cannot see. They can see ultraviolet or infrared light. The lens on the front part of the acts like a camera lens.
Tongue-twister: A tongue-twister is a phrase that is hard to say. They often use alliteration and homophones. They are commonly employed to help warm up singers and actors Tongue-twisters can range from simple phrases for beginners to complex sequences that require advanced vocal control. They are popular in language learning, helping non-native speakers improve their pronunciation and familiarity with tricky sounds. Additionally, tongue-twisters are often used in competitions or as games, where participants try to say them without stumbling
AbiWord: AbiWord is a free word processor that can be downloaded for free, it is open source and is much smaller in size than a proprietary alternative, Microsoft Word. It is available for FreeBSD, Linux, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and QNX. Its mascot is Abi the ant. It is much smaller than many other commercial word-processors of its time, only using about 15Mb on a computer's hard drive under Microsoft Windows.
Insect: Insects are a class in the phylum Arthropoda. They are small terrestrial invertebrates which have a hard exoskeleton. Insects are the largest group of animals on Earth by far: about 926,400 different species have been described. They are more than half of all known living species. They may be over 90% of animal species on Earth. New species of insects are continually being found. Estimates of the total number of species range from 2 million to 30 million. All adult insects have six legs; and most have wings.
Computer jargon: Computer jargon means words to do with computers and surrounding topics. Knowing what these words mean can help people know more about computers. Most people use these words to discuss computer ideas, but some people use these words to impress others (also known as buzzwords). Some examples of jargon are: *Disk - a place to store data. *Data - information stored on a computer. The amount of data that is stored on a disk is measured with the following terms: **Bit - the smallest data unit, can either be a "0" or a "1.
1000 (number): 1000 (1,000, one thousand or thousand for short) is the natural number after 999 and before 1001. One thousand thousands is known as a million. In Roman Numerals, 1000 is written as M.
Gross domestic product: In economics, gross domestic product (GDP) is how much a place produces in an amount of time. GDP can be calculated by adding up its output (total production) inside a country. To find the GDP of a country, one adds up all consumer spending (C), all investment (I), all government spending minus taxes (G), and the value of exports minus imports (X – M). This is shown by the equation:GDP = C + I + G + (X - M) This measure is often used to find out how healthy a country is; a country with a high value of GDP can be called a large economy.
Cricket: (Murali) of Sri Lanka bowls to Adam Gilchrist of Australia in a Twenty20 International match.The pale area of the field is the pitch, with a wicket in place at each end. The batter (Gilchrist) is using his bat to defend the wicket against the white ball which Murali has just bowled. Sri Lanka's wicket-keeper (#11) is crouching just behind the wicket which Gilchrist is defending. The other Sri Lanka player (#55) is a fielder operating in the "first slip" position. Gilchrist's partner, the "non-striker", stands by the other wicket at the bowler's end of the pitch.
Track and field athletics: Track and field is part of the sport of athletics. Athletics is a collection of sport events that includes running, jumping and throwing. Track and field events take place in a sports stadium, either on the running track, or on the field inside the running track. These tracks are generally made up of synthetic rubber – rubber particles bound with latex or polyurethane. Other athletics events that are not track and field, include cross country running, road running, marathon running, and race-walking - these events take place outside a sports stadium.
Badminton: Badminton is a sport for two or four( "singles" or "doubles") people. The game is either one player against one player or a team of two players against another team of two players. Players use rackets to hit a shuttlecock over a net but if it goes too far it will be an out. It is often enjoyed in various settings, from casual backyard matches to intense professional tournaments. The aim of the game is to hit the shuttlecock over the net in a way that the other player or pair cannot hit it back properly before it hits the floor.
Chemical warfare: Chemical warfare means using poisonous chemical compounds to injure or kill people in a war. Chemical warfare has been used since the Stone Age. Since 1899, several international laws have made it illegal to use chemical weapons. Still, chemical weapons have been used in wars since then.
Iran: Iran, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran and also known as Persia, is a country in West Asia. It shares borders with Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iraq, Pakistan, Turkey, Kuwait And Turkmenistan. Iran is divided into five regions with 31 provinces. Tehran is the capital and largest city.
Gautama Buddha: Siddhartha Gautama (c. 563 BC - c. 483 BC) was an ancient Indian Philosopher and the founder of Buddhism. He is better known by the title the Buddha which means "Fully Awakened One". He is also called Shakyamuni Buddha. This is because he was the sage of the Śākyan clan.
North: North is one of the 4 main directions on a compass. North is usually up on most maps. For Example: The United States is north of the Mexico, which is itself north of Brazil. The North Pole is the farthest north you can go. The North of the world is considered to be the top. English 850 words directions
GNOME Web: GNOME Web (sometimes called Epiphany) is a web browser for GNOME. The browser uses the WebKit browser engine to load web pages but supports extensions from Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome and uses Firefox Sync's API to allow syncing between multiple browsers. This also allows the browser to sync its bookmarks and reading list with Firefox and its mobile app. GNOME Web was originally made from Galeon by Marco Pesenti Gritti (also the creator of Galeon) with the aim of making a web browser with a very simple user experience.
Video game console: , a gaming console.]] A video game console is a machine that is used to play video games. Video game consoles usually connect to a television. Special controllers are attached to the console to control the game. Some video game consoles are handheld. They can be carried around and have their own screens. The Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable are examples of handheld consoles. Some video game consoles can also run general software, such as Linux.
PlayStation (console): The PlayStation (often known as the PS1 or the PSX) is a video game console made by Sony released in December 1994. At the time, it was competing against the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn. PlayStation games were stored on CDs. The controllers that were first released with the console had no analog joysticks on them, but analog joysticks and a vibration feature were added to later controllers. A slimmer version of the console called the PS One was released in 2000. It was white instead of grey. It was succeeded by the PlayStation 2 in March 2000 and was discontinued on March 23, 2006 (eight months before the PlayStation 3 was released).
Election: is picking one of several options (or candidates). The notice tells voters to "fold each ballot paper several times and hand it in separately".]] An election is a way people can choose their candidate or their preferences in a representative democracy or other form of government. Most democratic countries hold elections for their national legislature every few years. The elections select representatives for the local areas. These are called Members of Parliament in the British parliamentary system.
Medicine: ]] Medicine is the science that treats and prevents diseases in humans. Medical workers treat injuries, infections, and sickness. Medicine also helps people with disease prevention and the best ways to not get sick from bacteria or viruses. Medical doctors also help unhealthy (bad habits, overweight, underweight) people return to a healthy condition. People who practice medicine are most often called medical doctors or physicians. Often doctors work closely with nurses and many other types of health care workers.
Transport: Transport, or transportation, is moving people or things from one place to another place. Transport can be divided into infrastructure, vehicles and operations. Infrastructure includes cableways, roads, railways, airports, canals and pipelines. The infrastructure is the network where things are carried. Infrastructure also includes airports, railway stations, bus stations and seaports (docks). Infrastructure is usually built by governments and paid for by taxes from the citizens of a country or region.
Road: ]] ]] A road is a piece of land which connects two or more places. Usually, a road has been made easy to travel on. For example, by removing trees and stones so the ground is more level. Although, many roads are made of gravel and dirt, some are paved with concrete or bricks or stones. People have been making roads for a long time. Roman roads in Britain and the Inca road system are famous. Transport by boats on waterways was usually easier and faster than transport by road. In the industrial revolution, the railway was invented.
Hawaiian Islands: From west to east, Hawaii is made up of the following Hawaiian Islands: The chain of islands stretches 2,400 km (1500 miles) in a southeasterly direction to the southern tip of the Island of Hawaii The hot-spot which formed them moved South-East in the Pacific Ocean. The hot-spot in the Earth's crust moved to where it is now, near the island of Hawaii, or, rather, the hot spot stayed where it was, and the plates of the Earth's crust moved, so creating the islands. *Niihau *Kauai *Oahu *Moloka'i *Lana'i *Kaho'olawe *Maui *Hawaii Hawaii has been a U.
Mauna Kea: Mauna Kea is a dormant volcano on Hawaii Island, in the state of Hawaii, United States. It is the highest point in Hawaii at 4,205 meters. If measured from top to bottom, below sea level, it is 10,200 meters high and would be the tallest mountain in the world. It is around 1,000,000 years old. Mauna Kea means 'white mountain' because in winter it often has snow at the summit.
Mauna Loa: Mauna Loa is an active volcano on Hawaii Island, in the state of Hawaii, United States. It is considered to be the largest subaerial (from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean) volcano in the world and the tallest volcano in Hawaii.
Kilauea: Kīlauea is an active volcano in the Hawaiian Islands. It is a shield volcano. The volcano is 1,277 eruption of Kīlauea is estimated as 300 to 600 thousand years ago. Its first recorded eruptions were in 1823. Its most recent eruption was April 7 2025. It is still erupting now. The Hawaiian name Kīlauea means "spewing" or "much spreading". It refers to the constant flow of lava. Kīlauea lies on the curve of volcanoes on the island of Hawaii that includes Mauna Loa and Kohala. The volcano of Kīlauea is one of the youngest and also is said to be the home of an ancient volcano goddess Pele.
Van: low roof van ]] A van is a type of road vehicle used for transporting goods or people. There is some variation in the scope of the word across the different English-speaking countries, Depending on the type of van, it can be bigger or smaller than a pickup truck and SUV, and longer and higher than a car but relatively smaller than a truck/lorry or a bus. The smallest vans, microvans, are used for transporting either goods or people in tiny quantities.

Paperback: A paperback is a type of book. It has a cover of thick paper or thin cardboard. Paperback book covers can bend and be folded. The covers are laminated (have layers), and some of the methods are more durable (lasting) than others. Another name for paperback is soft cover. Paperback books may be glued or held by sewing. If the pages are held only by adhesive, the book will eventually come apart. The quality of the paper also varies. It is generally less white than bound hardback books because it is less bleached.
Palette: A palette is used for mixing colours.They are usually made out of plastic or wood but can be made out of other materials. An artist often uses one of these and is in fact an essential item in art, when painting.
Glow-worm: A glow-worm is an insect. Other names for it are "fireworm", "lightning worm" and "lightworm". There are several insects given this name. Most are beetles, but one is a fly, Arachnocampa. They are nocturnal, active during the night. They have special organs that can produce light. This is used to find mates. The patterns in which the beetles flash is unique to each species. The major families are *Lampyridae (Fireflies). The adult female of this family has no wings. It is the glow worm of the literature.
Palette knife: A palette knife is not actually a knife. It has a very flexible steel blade and no sharpened cutting edge. It is a tool.
Foolscap: Foolscap is paper cut to the size of , sometimes . This was a traditional paper size used in Europe and the British Commonwealth, before the adoption of the international standard A4 paper, the most common standard size in the world. Foolscap was so called because, in the 18th century, folio-sized paper had the watermark of a fool's cap on it. Basically, it is taller than A4. In North America, foolscap is lined, legal-size paper. In some South American countries it is called "oficio", because it is or was used for official documents.
Polymer: and polypropylene]] A polymer is a molecule, made from joining many small molecules called monomers. The word "polymer" can be broken down into "poly" (meaning "many" in Greek) and "mer" (meaning "unit"). This shows how the chemical composition of a polymer consists of many smaller units (monomers) bonded together into a larger molecule. A chemical reaction bonding monomers together to make a polymer is called polymerization. Some polymers are natural and made by organisms. Proteins have polypeptide molecules, which are natural polymers made from various amino acid monomer units.
Medium: Medium might mean: * Medium, a size between small and large * Medium (spirituality), a person who claims to communicate with the dead * Interstellar medium, the matter between stars * Optical gain medium * Storage medium, a device for storing information * Transmission medium, a solid, liquid, gas, or plasma that can transmit energy * Growth medium, a solid or liquid material in which an organism can grow.
Phrase: A phrase is a group of words that adds meaning to a sentence. A phrase is not a sentence because it is not a complete idea with a subject, verb and a predicate. English has five different kinds of phrases, one for each of the main parts of speech. In a phrase, the main word or the word that is that is the subject of the phrase is called the head. In the following examples, it is printed in bold. The other words in the phrase do the work of changing, or modifyingm the head. In a noun phrase, one or more words work together to give more information about a noun.
Preposition: Prepositions often describe the position of something, the time when something happens or the way in which something is done. The prepositions "of", "to" and "for" have other functions. Prepositions may sometimes be used to end sentences. For example, "What did you put that there for?" (better English is the alternative: "Why did you put that there?") Example 2: "A pen is a device to write with" (better English is "A pen is a writing device"). In general, because they are links, prepositions belong in the middle of sentences, rather than at the end.
Pronoun: A pronoun is traditionally a part of speech in grammar, but many modern linguists call it a type of noun. In English, pronouns are words such as me, she, his, them, herself, each other, it, what. Pronouns are often used to take the place of a noun, to avoid repeating the noun. For example, instead of saying *Tom has a new dog. Tom has named the dog Max, and Tom lets the dog sleep by Toms bed. it is easier to say *Tom has a new dog. He has named him Max and he lets him sleep by his bed. When a pronoun replaces a noun, the noun is called the antecedent.
Adverb: An adverb is a word used to tell more about a verb, and it almost always answers the questions how?, when?, where?, how often?, and in what way?. Words like slowly, loudly, carefully, quickly, quietly or sadly are all adverbs. Adverbs usually, but not always, end in -ly. Examples of adverbs in a sentence (with the adverb in italics): * How did the man walk? The man walked slowly. * How did the dogs bark? The dogs barked loudly. An adverb can also modify (describe) an adjective or another adverb Examples: *Adverb modifying a verb He writes well *Adverb modifying another adverb: He writes very w...
Sunday: ]] Sunday is one of the seven days of the week. It is part of the weekend, along with Saturday. Sunday is the Sabbath or day of worship for most Christians (for example, Easter is celebrated on Sunday). Sunday is the beginning of the week in the United States, but is the end of the week in the United Kingdom. 07

The region has about 1,146,790 people. The mayor of the city today (since November 2022) is Mark Sutcliffe. Ottawa is in the Ottawa Valley on the border with the province of Quebec which is divided by the Ottawa River. Ottawa is the fourth largest city in Canada and the second largest city in Ontario (after Toronto). Ottawa is the only officially bilingual city in Canada, where the English language and the French language are official languages and have equal status.
Mudguard: A mudguard, fender or wing is a part covering the wheels of a vehicle to stop it from throwing off mud, water or objects from the road. It protects people and property from dirtiness, dampness, and damage. Mudguards protect in several ways: # They protect brakes and lights. # They protect the bicycle from getting rusted by mud and water. # They protect clothes from being dirty. # They protect from injuries. parts
Para rubber tree: A Para rubber tree (or simply, rubber tree) is the tree which naturally produces rubber. It is native to tropical areas from South America, in the Amazon (Brazil), but was spread by European farmers to the Far East. Para Rubber trees belong to the Euphorbiaceae family. In the wild they may reach heights of 100 to 125 ft (30-38 m) with large cylindrical trunks with or without buttresses. Crop trees reach a width of about 20 in. (50 cm), usually with a short bole, and with a sloped taper. Most rubber plantations are in South Asia and Southeast Asia.
Safety curtain: A safety curtain is a curtain in theatre at the front of the stage. It is made of material that will not burn. The safety curtain may be lowered during the intermission and after the performance. A safety curtain is there in case there is a fire on stage. It will stop the fire from spreading to the auditorium where the audience sits. terminology
Christmas stocking: A Christmas stocking is a long sock hung by a fireplace or bed on Christmas Eve. Christmas presents are put into it for children. It came from an old legend. Stockings are now a European Christmas tradition.
2001: 2001 (MMI) was a common year starting on Monday in the Gregorian calendar. It was the first year of the 3rd millennium and 21st century.
Sex: are among those animals that reproduce with sex.]] s with small stolons. They are a way of asexual reproduction.]] Sex is a type of reproduction common among living things. Sex is used by plants and animals, and also by fungi and various single-celled organisms. It usually needs two individuals which are different sexes from the same species. It works by combining genes from more than one source.
Hacksaw: A hacksaw is a tool for sawing. A hacksaw is designed for cutting materials like very thin metals and plastic. It has a handle on one end, and can be either pushed or pulled across the object being cut. There are manual and electric hacksaws. tools
Spade: In gardening, a spade is a tool for digging. It is similar to a shovel. It has a straight handle, usually of wood and a blade, usually of steel. For some purposes the difference between a spade and a shovel is important. For example, spade more easily digs in hard soil; a shovel more easily moves gravel. In card games a spade is one of the four shapes or "suits" of cards. English 850 words tools
Hoe (tool): A hoe is a tool in farming and gardening. It has a blade, usually metal, attached to a long handle, usually wood. There are many types of blade and several uses, probably the most common of which is weeding. Other uses include shaping the soil and harvesting root crops such as potatoes. Along with the spade and fork, the hoe is considered a basic, essential hand farming implement. tools
Shovel: A shovel is a tool used for moving loose material. Shovels have a flat bottom head which is angled slightly from the handle to enable scooping and moving of material. Although a shovel can be used for digging, it is much less efficient than a spade. Spades are straight, and transmit force straight downwards. Shovels move loose material, such as coal, snow, gravel etc. They are usually made of metal at the bottom, and wood is sometimes used for the handle.
Plunger: A plunger is a tool. It is used to get rid of things that are blocking pipes. The plunger is placed over one end of the pipe, and the handle is pushed up and down. Doing this creates a sucking force, which makes the thing blocking the pipe move and unclog.
Ladder: ]] A ladder is a tool which is made for people to climb up or down. Ladders have two vertical supports that go along the whole length of the ladder. Between these supports are the horizontal rungs. The rung is what the climber can put his foot on. The climber can use his hands to hold on to the rungs above him, or to the supports at the side. Some ladders are made in one piece. They can be carried around and made to lean against something such as the wall of a house. There should be a good distance between the bottom of the ladder and the wall so that the ladder is not too vertical, otherwise the ladder might fall backwards and the climber would fall off.
Oral history: Oral history is history that is told rather than written down. It is given through talking rather than reading a book. It is usually passed from generation to generation in order to explain events that have occurred. Though today oral history is not as popular as written history, it is still used in many places as a way of transferring knowledge about the past. *
Generation: A generation means any group that is sorted by the time they were born. In a family, a generation means all the people on one level of a family tree. For example, your brothers, sisters and cousins are in the same generation as you. In populations of people, a “generation” means groups of people born in different periods of time. Each generation lasts for the average amount of time between the birth of parents, and the birth of their children. Examples of generations: *Generation Beta: 2025 to 2039 *Generation Alpha: 2013 to 2028 *Generation Z: 1997 to 2012 *Millennials: 1981 to 1996 *Generati...
Gene: Genes are parts of DNA. DNA is a molecule inside a cell that carries the instructions for making the proteins the cell will need. Each gene contains one or more sets of instructions These instructions usually code for a particular protein. (For example coding for the protein that would make your hair brown, or blonde). Humans have about 20,000 genes that code proteins and many more that are non-coding. Half of a person's genes come from the mother. The other half come from the father.
Alliteration: Alliteration is when a sentence or phrase has words that start with the same sound. It is commonly used in advertising, poetry, headlines, and tongue-twisters. Basically the first consonant repeats itself throughout the sentence. Alliteration is common for poetry. It was used one thousand years ago in Anglo-Saxon poems. A fine example is a strophe from The Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Samuel Taylor Coleridge: : The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew, : The furrow followed free; : We were the first that ever burst : Into that silent sea.
Homophone: Homophones are words that sound the same as another word but have a different meaning, and often a different spelling. Examples include: * one, won * pail, pale * fore, four, for * it's, its * there, their, they're * Knight, night * which, witch * pore, pour * pear, pair, pare * see, sea, C * high, hi * wear, where * hare, hair * air, heir * whether, weather * too, to, two * ate, eight * no, know * by, buy, bye * flour, flower * right, write * be, bee * week, weak * rains, reins * higher, hire * fare, fair * prince, prints
Condensation: condenses into a liquid after making contact with the surface of a cold bottle.]] Condensation is how gas changes into a liquid when it touches a cooler surface. Condensation is part of the water cycle. It is the opposite of evaporation.
Precipitation: Precipitation is the falling of water from the atmosphere. It is a term in meteorology, and includes rain, snow, sleet, ice pellets, dew, frost, and hail. These form by condensation from atmospheric water vapor, and fall under gravity. Fog and mist are not precipitation but suspensions. In that case, the water vapor does not condense sufficiently to precipitate. If liquid, precipitation can be measured using a rain gauge. The most common form of solid precipitation is snow. Snow is made when temperatures are so cold that water vapor changes directly to solid crystals.
Relative humidity: Relative humidity is a way of describing how much humidity is present in the air, compared to how much there could be. Meteorologists often use the relative humidity as a measurement to describe the weather at various places. When the temperature is warm, more water vapor can be in the air than when it is cold. If the actual amount of vapor is compared to the total amount there could be as a fraction, then the number tells if the air feels dry or moist. The value is usually written in percent, where 0% means that the air is totally dry, and 100% means that it is so moist that mist or dew is about to form.
Vitamin C: Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is a vitamin. It is found in fresh fruits, berries and vegetables. It is one of the water-soluble vitamins. Vitamin C is important in wound healing. Without enough vitamin C, a person can get a sickness called scurvy. Lack of vitamin C was a serious health problem on long ocean trips where supplies of fresh fruit were quickly used up. Many people died from scurvy on such trips. Most animals make their own vitamin C. Some mammals cannot. Those that cannot include the main suborder of primates, the Haplorrhini: these are the tarsiers, monkeys and apes, including humans.
Dichlorphenolindophenol: DCPIP (its full name is 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol) is a blue chemical used as a dye because when it is oxidized it is blue. Once DCPIP is reduced (by addition of electrons) it does not have a color anymore. This reaction can be reversed, and the colourless DCPIP will turn blue again, when it is oxidized.
Healthy diet: A healthy diet or balanced diet is a diet (food that you eat) that contains the right amounts of all the food groups. It includes fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy products, and protein. It does not include too much or too little of any kind of food. Eating wrong amounts of a food group, whether it be too much or too little, is called an 'unhealthy diet' or an 'imbalanced diet'. A healthy diet is one that includes more foods that come from plants, animals and fewer convenience foods.
Dye: Dye is a substance used to color materials. It is often used to color the fabric used to make clothing. It has low solubility. A pigment will not do this because it will not stick to the fibers of the fabric and color them. A dye can be natural, usually made from plant material such as berries, or a dye can be artificial, meaning that it is made by humans from chemicals such as petrochemicals. Most natural dyes are gotten from different parts of a plant like the roots, fruits, bark, leaves, wood, fungi and lichens. Most dyes are synthetic and are made from petrochemicals.
Poetry: Poetry is written, spoken or sung language that is used in stronger or more original ways than prose is used. Poetry uses the meanings of words as prose does; but it also uses the sounds of words as if they were music, especially rhymes, other repeating sounds, and rhythms (beats or meters). Poetry arranges words and groups of words to make repetitions and parallelisms. Poetry uses figures of speech, ellipses and delayed identification to suggest that there is more meaning in the language. Some people believe that poetry began when language began.
Literature: depicting a stack of books on which are inscribed the names of great German writers.]] ]] Literature is a group of works of art that are made of words. Most are written, but some are shared by word of mouth. Literature usually means a work of poetry, theatre or narrative. There are many different kinds of literature, such as poetry, plays, or novels. They can also be put into groups by their language, historical time, place of origin, Latin word "literatura," which means "writing formed with letters.
Imagination: Imagination is the ability to form images of things or events in one's mind. When someone imagines something, they are trying to picture something in their mind that they are not experiencing at the moment or that is not really happening.
Calorimeter: and Pierre-Simon Laplace, to measure the heat generated by chemical changes. The calculations were based on Joseph Black’s discovery of latent heat. These experiments started thermochemistry.]] A calorimeter is a tool that measures the amount of thermal energy contained in a substance, or released in a reaction. A commonplace use is to measure heat of combustion. equipment tools
Bolus: In biology, a bolus (from the Latin word for ball), is a ball-shaped living thing. In medicine, a bolus is a large amount of a drug given to patients to raise the blood level before treatment. A bolus can also refer to a ball of food after it has been chewed. It passes down the oesophagus by peristalsis.
Oesophagus: The oesophagus (or esophagus) is also called the gullet. It is the part of the gastrointestinal system between the mouth and the stomach. It connects the pharynx and the stomach. It is about long. The oesophagus is lined with muscle, and is lubricated. Its muscle pushes food down into the stomach. The oesophagus can contract or expand to allow for the passage of food. The muscular movement that pushes the food down the oesophagus is called peristalsis. At the entrance to the stomach there is a ring of muscle called a sphincter.
Protease: A protease is a digestive enzyme. It breaks down long chains of proteins into shorter amino acids. Proteases have evolved a number of times. We know this because different kinds of protease can do the same reaction in completely different ways. Proteases are found in animals, plants, bacteria, archaea and viruses. Now more than 50 types of protease are known. Each is a separate evolutionary origin of proteolysis. Protease can be divided into 6 types : *serine proteases *threonine proteases *cysteine proteases *aspartate proteases *metallo proteases *glutamic acid proteases
Dental floss: Dental floss is a special type of thread. It is used for cleaning spaces between teeth which cannot be reached by toothbrushes. It is important to floss before brushing teeth and to floss at least once a day. Tooth brushing will not clean food that is packed between teeth. This 'food packing' can lead to unhealthy teeth and gums. Bacteria grow in this 'packed food' between teeth. These bacteria cause the surface of teeth (enamel) to break down. Then the teeth and gums and sometimes even the jaw can become seriously diseased.
Rickets: Rickets is a disease that happens in young children. It happens in children who do not get enough vitamin D and calcium. It causes larger spaces inside bones, and makes them dry, like sponges. It can make the legs curve toward each other (so the knees touch) or away from each other. Rickets in adults is called osteomalacia. The word "rickets" comes from the Greek word rhakhis, which means "spine."
Bile: Bile or gall is an alkaline, green-yellow fluid. It is secreted from the liver of most vertebrate animals, and is often stored in the gall bladder. Bile helps digest fat. The components of bile are, in descending order of composition, the following: * Water * Cholesterol * Bile pigments * Bile salts The name gall comes from the Greek word cholè meaning green or yellow. These colours come from the bile pigments. One of them is green and the other is yellow. When they are mixed together, they make feces brown.

The cytoplasm is pressed against the cell wall by the very large vacuole. In this picture the cell nuclei are dark-coloured.]] "Protoplasm" is an old term which means the living substance that makes up a cell. It is no longer much used. Biologists prefer to talk about the cytoplasm and the cell nucleus. In plant cells, it is surrounded by a cell wall. In animal cells, the whole cell is made of protoplasm, surrounded by a cell membrane.
Amylase: Amylase is an enzyme which breaks down starch into sugars which the body can use. More accurately, it is a family of similar enzymes which work in a wide range of animals, plants and fungi. There are two variants in humans: alpha-amylase, and gamma-amylase. Alpha-amylase is a major digestive enzyme. Its optimum pH is 6.7–7.0. It is found in saliva and pancreatic juice. It takes starch chains and breaks them into smaller pieces with two or three glucose units. It can break down starch into maltose.
Seam ripper: A seam ripper is a cutting tool. It is used for removing stitches in sewing and cutting open buttonholes made on a sewing machine. Sometimes it is also called a thread ripper. The tool usually has a handle, shaft, and head. The head has two points: one flattened to form a pointed blade and the other forming a small point. To use a seam ripper to remove sewn threads, the blade is placed underneath the thread to be cut. The thread slips down between the two points, and the tool is then lifted upwards allowing the blade to cut through the thread. Then the loose thread ends can be removed. tools

Hill: , England]] A hill is a landform that is higher than the surrounding terrain and that is smaller than a mountain. Hill is a highland of much lower elevation than a mountain. Normally it is not as steep as a mountain. By definition, a hill is often described as being lower than 600 meters (about 2,000 feet). However, some definitions say a hill is lower than 300 meters (about 1,000 feet). The surface of a hill is much more stable than that of a dune. Hill have long been used for hill forts
Enzyme: An enzyme is a protein molecule in cells which works as a biological catalyst. Enzymes speed up chemical reactions in the body, but do not get used while doing so, so they can be used over and over again. Almost all biochemical reactions in living things need enzymes. With an enzyme, chemical reactions go much faster than they would without the enzymes.p39 Other biocatalysts are catalytic RNA molecules, called ribozymes. The substances at the start of a reaction are called substrates. The substances at the end of a reaction are the products.
Mountain: , the tallest mountain in the world]] on the Austrian Italian border]] in Greece]] in Valle d'Aosta in the Italian Alps]] A mountain is a large natural rise of the Earth's surface that usually has a "summit" (the name for a mountain's top, which can also be called a peak).

Machine code is the lowest level of software. Other programming languages are translated into machine code so the computer can execute them. An instruction tells the process what operation to perform. Each instruction is made up of an opcode (operation code) and operand(s). The operands are usually memory addresses or data. An instruction set is a list of the opcodes available for a computer.
Area: Area is the amount of space a two dimensional (flat) surface takes up. It is useful because it is how much of a material is needed to make a hollow container. Area is the amount of surface covered by a close object or shape. Some units used to measure area are square foot, square mile, square metre and square kilometre. The area of a planar figure is often written as A. Areas of regular shapes such as square, rectangle, triangle and circle can be calculated through Scientific method One can use different [[formulas to find the area of different shapes.

Glass rod: Glass rods are sometimes used as stirrers in laboratory environments. Glass rods are often used to spread liquids evenly onto something. An example would be to coat glass surfaces with liquids to look at them under a microscope. Glass rods rubbed with silk or fur were used in early demonstrations of electrical energy. Glass rods are commonly manufactured in diameters of 3 mm, 6 mm, and 10 mm. Glass is used for these rods because it does not react with most laboratory chemicals. equipment
Thermometer: A thermometer is an instrument for measuring or showing temperature (how hot or cold something is). One type of thermometer is a narrow, concealed glass tube containing mercury or alcohol which extends along the tube as it expands. Another type is a digital thermometer, which uses electronics to measure temperature. Early thermometers from the time of Galileo measured the expansion and contraction of air. After the middle 17th century, people more often used alcohol or mercury thermometers. In the 19th century, a mechanical thermometer was invented that used a bimetallic strip to move a pointer.

The probe Giotto from the European Space Agency managed the closest approach to the comet.
Hubble Space Telescope: Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is the first big optical space observatory telescope. Being above the atmosphere means it can see the sky more clearly than a telescope on the ground. The atmosphere blurs starlight before it reaches Earth. Named after the astronomer Edwin Hubble, the Hubble Space Telescope can observe 24 hours a day. The main mirror is 94.5 inches (2.4 meters) across. The telescope can take pictures of things so far away it would be nearly impossible to see them from anywhere else. It was made by both NASA and the ESA working together.

For example: (Germany is located to the west of Poland, which is itself located to the west of Lithuania). When “The West” is used in everyday speech: it usually refers to the nations of Europe (Especially from Croatia Westward) and its daughter states in the Americas and Australasia. The sun and moon also set in the west. English 850 words directions
President: , 33rd U.S. president from 1945 to 1953]] A president is the leader of a country which is a republic. A president is usually elected directly through a vote by the citizens or indirectly by legislatures (parliaments) who were voted by the citizens and which represents them. Some presidents are both the head of state and head of government, such as the President of the United States. In other countries, such as the Republic of Ireland, the President has a ceremonial role while the Prime Minister is the leader of the government.

Agreement: is often used to mean that there is an agreement.]] An agreement is writing down a promise made. Agreements are common in law and business. For example, when a person takes out a loan or hires someone to work, an agreement is usually signed so that everyone understands what and when things must be done.
Promise: When a person agrees to do something or to not do something, that person is making a promise. A promise can be made verbally (by saying it), or it can be written down as a contract. Breaking a promise, or not keeping it, is often just bad manners, but it can sometimes be illegal, such as when a contract is not kept. A vow is a special promise. It is mostly used in a religious sense or in ceremonies such as marriages when the couple who are being married make their "marriage vows", promising to be faithful to one another.
Cloud: ]] A cloud is water vapour in the atmosphere (sky) that has condensed into very small water droplets or ice crystals that appear in visible shapes or formations above the ground. Water on the Earth evaporates (turns into an invisible gas) and rises up into the sky. Higher up where the air is colder, the water condenses: it changes from a gas to drops of water or crystals of ice. We see these drops of water as clouds. The drops fall back down to earth as rain, and then the water evaporates again. This is called the "water cycle".
Water vapor: Water vapor is water that is in the form of a vapor, or gas. It is a part of the water cycle. When liquid water is heated to boiling point, 100 °C (212 °F), it turns into vapor. Water vapor can also be produced directly from ice; this is called sublimation. Steam is water vapor, but clouds are liquid water. The amount of water vapor in air is called humidity and it affects weather conditions. In the cold, breathing out causes the water vapor in the breath to freeze. Water vapor weighs less than air, thus it slightly reduces the lift produced by an aircraft wing.
Solid: Solid is one of the four common states of matter. The molecules in solids are closely bound together, so they can only vibrate. This means solids have a definite shape that only changes when a force is applied. This is different to liquids and gases which move randomly, a process called flow. Solids can resist forces applied to their surface. When a solid becomes a liquid, this is called melting. Liquids become solid by freezing. Some solids, like dry ice, can turn into gas without turning liquid first. This is called sublimation.
Evaporation: Evaporation is when a liquid becomes a gas without forming bubbles inside the liquid volume. If bubbles are formed we are talking instead about "boiling". For example, water left in a bowl will slowly disappear. The water evaporates into water vapor, the gas phase of water. The water vapor mixes with the air. The opposite of evaporation is condensation. When the molecules in a liquid are heated, they move faster. This makes them full of energy and so the particles collide with each other, and eventually they become so far apart that they become a gas.
Contract: or promise between two or more people.]] A contract is an agreement or promise that the law can enforce. The law will enforce some agreements but not others. For example, in most places, if a parent promises to take a child to get ice cream, the law will not enforce that promise as a legal contract. The legal rules about which promises are enforced by the law can be different in different places (or jurisdictions), but a contract is usually enforced only if it is made by people or groups who want it to be enforced and who know what they are doing.
Face: The face is a part of the body at the front of the head. It is the part of us that others interact with. On the face are organs of sight, smell, hearing. Especially in a four-legged animal, the face is the part which goes first into the world, and that is why the sense organs and the mouth are there. In humans, the face includes the hair, forehead, eyebrow, eyelash, eyes, nose, ears, cheeks, mouth, lips, teeth, skin, and chin. English 850 words
Kolkata: Kolkata (spelled Calcutta before 1 January 2001) is the capital city of the Indian state of West Bengal. It is the second largest city in India after Mumbai. It is on the east bank of the River Hooghly. When it is called Calcutta, it includes the suburbs. This makes it the third largest city of India. It is also known as city of joy It has 4,500,000 (4.5 million) people living in it. This also makes it the world's 8th largest metropolitan area as defined by the United Nations. Kolkata served as the capital of India during the British Raj until 1911.
Pencil: pencils]] , commonly called pencil lead). 2. Wood. 3. Painted body. 4. Ferrule. 5. Eraser.]] A pencil is a kind of writing equipment that is also used to draw, usually on paper. Most pencil cores are made of graphite powder mixed with a clay binder. So, a pencil is usually made with a piece of graphite mixed with clay that has a wood case around it. The shape is usually a hexagonal prism but some pencils are square or cylinder. Colored pencils are a kind that do not use greyish silver graphite. Instead, the core is colorful.
Logic: can be seen in a cave.]] Logic is the study of reasoning. The rules of logic let philosophers make logical deductions about the world. Logic helps us decide whether something can be true or false.
Communism: Communism is an idea in politics based on equality, that seeks a world without different social class groups. They say that things like factories, tools and farms (the relations of production) are owned by the bourgeoisie. Communists want the workers to take power and the means of production. They believe this will bring about the end of all money and private property. This is the opposite to capitalism where there is money, and a state and class structure. In capitalism, there is a working class (people who don't own the means of production, also called the proletariat) and the owning class (people who own the means of production, sometimes called the ruling class or the bourgeoisie).
Monarchy: A monarchy is a kind of government where a monarch, a kind of hereditary ruler (someone who inherits their office), is the head of state. Monarchs usually rule until they die or pass down (when a monarch resigns it is called abdication). Most monarchies are hereditary, but some are elected. The most famous elected monarch is the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church. Some well known titles for monarchs are King, Queen, Emperor, Empress, Czar, Kaiser, Shah, Emir, Khan and Sultan. In less formal societies, the leader was often chosen by fighting.
North Korea: North Korea, officially called the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) is a country in the northern part of the Korean peninsula in East Asia. North Korea is next to China, Russia, and South Korea. The capital city of North Korea is Pyongyang, which is also the largest city in the country. The country was founded in 1948 after it had been freed from Japanese occupation, and a socialist state backed by the Soviet Union was established. The Republic of Korea is the southern half of the Korean Peninsula, and was occupied by the United States, and the U.
Parliament: , London]] A parliament is a type of legislature. The most famous parliament is probably the Parliament of the United Kingdom, which is sometimes called the "Mother of all Parliaments". The word "parliament" comes from the French word parler, which means a talk. The Althing, the national parliament of Iceland, was founded earlier (930 AD), so it is the oldest legislature in the world still existing. However, the Althing did not function as a legislature for four centuries, and its role as a primary legislature is modern.
Turing test: The Turing test is a test to see if a computer can interact with a person. The human should not be able to realize it is interacting with a computer. Alan Turing thought that if a human could not tell the difference between another human and the computer, then the computer had shown intelligent behavior.
Fuel: A fuel is a substance that is changed in some way to produce heat, electricity, or other forms of energy. This is usually by being burnt in fire, although there are exceptions, such as nuclear fuel. Fuel can be divided into two main types: fossil fuels and other fuels.
Estonia: Estonia (), officially the Republic of Estonia () is a country by the Baltic Sea in Northern Europe. The capital city is Tallinn. Estonia has borders with Sweden, Finland, Russia and Latvia. Its population is 1,332,893. The territory includes the mainland and 2,222 islands in the Baltic Sea.
Cyprus: Cyprus (officially the Republic of Cyprus) is an island country in the Mediterranean Sea. Cyprus is in Asia, along with being apart of the Middle East and the Levant. The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), a de facto state only recognized by Turkey is situated in the north of the island. It is also closer to Africa than to Europe. The capital is Nicosia. The country of Cyprus does not include the whole island. There are two small British territories on the island named Akrotiri and Dhekelia.
Latvia: Latvia (Latvian: Latvija), officially the Republic of Latvia (Latvijas Republika), is a country in Northern Europe. The capital is Riga. It is one of the Baltic states, together with Estonia in the north and Lithuania in the south. Latvia's neighbours to the east are the countries Russia and Belarus. Latvia is divided into four parts: Kurzeme, Vidzeme, Zemgale, and Latgale. People from Latvia are called Latvians. They speak the Latvian language, which is a little like the Lithuanian language but is not close enough to be understood.
Lithuania: Lithuania is a country in Europe. It borders Latvia to the north, Belarus to the southeast, Poland to the south and Russia to the southwest. It is one of the Baltic states.
Malta: Malta is a country in Southern Europe, and a member of the European Union. It is an island near the center of the Mediterranean Sea, south of Sicily. Although it is geologically located on the African Plate, Malta is recognized as a European country. The capital of Malta is Valletta. Around 500,000 people live in Malta and it is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. Malta is 316 sq km, which makes it one of the smallest countries and the smallest in the European Union. Its many cities and towns grew close to each other over time.
Comoving distance: In normal cosmology, 'comoving' distance or 'proper distance' is one of several distances measured by cosmologists to define distances between objects.
Shaanxi: Shaanxi (Chinese:陕西, also sometimes called Shenshi) is a province in northwest China. The word "Shaan" (viz Shanzhou) is a place in Henan Province. "Xi" means "west". So "Shaanxi" means "the place to the west of Shaan". Although in pinyin, "Shaanxi" is spelled exactly the same as "Shanxi", the only difference in how the two words are pronounced is that the first syllable in "Shanxi" is said using the first tone in Mandarin, while the first syllable in "Shaanxi" is said with the third tone. Since tone markers are not usually used to show how to pronounce the two different names, the first word ...
Lisbon: Lisbon () is the capital (city) Lisbon is placed on the right bank (western) of the [[Tagus River, near the outfall. It has a pleasant climate and has about 220 days of sunshine each year. There are many beautiful beaches close to the city. There are also many seafood restaurants, [[history
Surfing: Surfing is a water sport done in the ocean or sea. The surfer uses their surfboard to catch a wave and ride in towards the shore. Surfing was invented by the Polynesians at least 4000 years ago. Surfing made its Olympic debut at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. It has become a popular sport among both men and women of all ages. With lifestyles and regimens freer than those of most sports, surfers comprise a unique culture. Though surfing is practiced in many other Pacific nations, its center remains Hawaii, where many rounds of the international surfing championships (the ASP) are held annually.
Lyon: Lyon (Arpitan: Liyon) is a city in the southeast of France. It is the third-largest city in the country (behind Paris and Marseille), with about 513,000 people living there in 2015. It is the second largest metropolis, or metro area, in France (behind only that of Paris), with about 2.3 million people in 2014. In ancient history, the name of Lyon was Lugdunum. Someone who lives in Lyon is called a Lyonnais (male) or a Lyonnaise (female) in French. Lyon has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa in the Koeppen climate classification).
George W. Bush: George Walker Bush (born July 6, 1946) is an American politician and businessman. He was the 43rd president of the United States from 2001 to 2009. He is the son of former U.S. President George H. W. Bush and former U.S. First Lady Barbara Bush. Before becoming president, he was the Governor of Texas from 1995 to 2000. Bush is a member of the Laura Welch and ran for the U.S. House of Representatives, but lost. He later co-owned the Texas Rangers baseball team. In 1994, he was elected Governor of Texas, defeating the incumbent governor, Democrat Ann Richards.
Organic compound: is one of the simplest organic compounds]] Organic compounds are carbon-based compounds. Organic compounds contain carbon bonds in which at least one carbon atom is covalently linked to an atom of another type (usually hydrogen, oxygen or nitrogen). Most polymers are organic compounds.
Coal: Coal is a hard rock which can be burned as a fossil fuel. It is mostly carbon but also contains hydrogen, sulphur, oxygen and nitrogen. It is a sedimentary rock formed from peat, by the pressure of rocks laid down later on top. Peat, and therefore coal, is formed from the remains of plants which lived millions of years ago in tropical wetlands (coal swamps), such as those of the late Carboniferous period (the Pennsylvanian). Charcoal is made by wood heated in an airless space. Coal can be burned for energy or heat.
Petroleum: Petroleum, (from Greek πέτρα - rock and έλαιο - oil) also called crude oil, is a thick and black liquid. It is a natural material mainly made of hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbons come from many billions of ancient phytoplankton. When they die, their bodies sink to the bottom. This formed basins of oil in many parts of the world. Most petroleum is found by drilling down through rocks on land or off-shore on the continental shelf. Major producers are in the Middle East, the Americas, and Russia. It is the most important world fuel source.
Natural gas: . It has been burning continuously since 1971, fed by the rich natural gas deposits in the area.]] Natural gas is a mixture of gases. It consists mainly of hydrocarbons. The main component is methane, which is a greenhouse gas. Natural gas is a natural resource, often found in the ground, either alone or together with petroleum. Landfills and natural processes produce a little methane. Usually it is transported to users in a pipeline. Most natural gas is burnt as a fuel to produce energy. It burns with a blue flame.
Energy: Energy can mean various things: * In physics, energy is a property of matter and space. It can be transferred between objects. It can be converted in its form. It cannot be created or destroyed. * In economics it may mean the ‘energy industry’, as in fuel or electric power distribution. * Energy can be used to heat, move or illuminate. * In everyday use, the word is used to describe someone acting or speaking in a lively and vigorous way.
Jewel: Jewels (or gems or gemstones) are rare minerals. They usually come in colours and sizes. They begin in a rough rock form, but can be cut and polished to turn into a jewellery. However, some other non-mineral rocks (such as lapis lazuli) or organic materials can also be also used for jewelry and are called gemstones. These include amber or jet. Pearls and coral are sometimes also called gemstones. Most gemstones are hard. Soft minerals are used in jewelry too, because of their luster that gives them value. Being rare or in short supply also makes a gemstone valuable.
Xenon: Xenon is a non-metal chemical element. It has the chemical symbol Xe and atomic number 54. As a noble gas, it is one of the few elements that are a gas at the standard temperature and pressure. Sir William Ramsay and M. W. Travers discovered this element in 1898. The element's name came from the Greek word xenos, which means 'stranger'.
Kuala Lumpur: Kuala Lumpur () is the capital city and the largest city of Malaysia and a Federal Territory. After Putrajaya was constructed in the late 1990s, the administrative capital has been moved there. Kuala Lumpur has one of the tallest buildings in the world, the Petronas Twin Towers.
Speed of light: The speed of light, in any medium, which is usually denoted by c, is a physical constant important in many areas of physics. It is denoted by "c0" especially in vacuum medium, although the symbol 'c' can be used to refer to that in any medium. It is exactly by definition. A photon (particle of light) travels at this speed in a vacuum. According to special relativity, c is the maximum speed at which all energy, matter, and physical information in the universe can travel. It is the speed of all massless particles such as photons, and associated fields—including electromagnetic radiation such as light—in a vacuum.
Denial: Denial is a word used in psychology on defense mechanism. It means that someone denies that something has happened or is happening although he really knows it is true. Usually this happens because admitting it would cause a lot of pain. Denial is usually the first state of coping with losses.
Tokyo: Tokyo () is the capital and largest city of Japan. It is on the island of Honshu in the region of Kanto. Tokyo is the center of the Japanese government. The Imperial Palace is in Tokyo but it's not actually public for tourists to visit. Tokyo is the center of business, trade, and industry of Japan. The city is the center of the second largest metropolitan area in the world. It faces Tokyo Bay. It became the capital city of Japan in the middle of 19th century, when its name changed from "Edo" to "Tokyo".
Brass: Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc. Some types of brass are called bronzes. Brass has a golden appearance. It is harder than pure metals and resists corrosion. It costs more than zinc. There are some common brasses: * Alpha brasses - with less than 40% zinc * Beta brasses - * White brasses - with more than 45% zinc Things brass are used to make include: * Brass instruments * Ornaments * Electrical fittings * Buttons * Screws * Taps * Hinges * Door knobs
Body: A body is the physical material of a person or organism. It is only used for organisms which are in one part or whole. There are organisms which change from single cells to whole organisms: for example, slime moulds. For them the term 'body' would mean the multicellular stage. Other uses: *Plant body *Cell body: here it may be used for cells like neurons which have long axons (nerve fibres). The cell body is the part with the nucleus in it. The body of a dead person is also called a corpse or cadaver.
Alloy: of brass alloy (Copper and zinc).]] An alloy is a uniform mixture. It is made up of two or more chemical elements, of which at least one is a metal. An alloy has properties different from the metals it is made of. Most alloys are made by melting the metals, mixing them while they are liquid to form a solution, then leaving them to cool and turn solid again.
Material: Material is what everything that you can touch is made of. Even material that is too small to touch, is called material. We use materials to make things. We can also call material "physical substances." Raw material is materials such as ores which we can clean and mix with other materials to make another material like steel, for example. Cotton is a raw material used to make textiles, which are used to make clothes. Material is not matter, though. Matter is everything in existence. Material is used for things that have use.
Brain: The brain is the part of the body which lets living beings think. It does some bodily functions, such as telling the rest of the body what to do. Almost all animals have a brain: the exceptions are sponges, cnidarians, and lancelets. Plants and fungi do not have brains, although they do react to changes in their environment. The brain is made up of special cells called nerves, which are connected with each other and with other nerves in our body. The brain gets input from sense organs, and changes behavior in response to this information.
Neuron: A neuron (or neurone) is a nerve cell that carries electrical impulses. Neurons are the basic units of our nervous system. Neurons have a cell body (soma or cyton), dendrites and an axon. Dendrites and axons are nerve fibers. There are about 86 billion neurons in the human brain. Almost all brain cells are neurons. The human brain has about 16 billion neurons in the cerebral cortex. The neurons are supported by glial cells and astrocytes.[https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320289] Neurons are connected to one another, but they do not actually touch each other.
Middle East: The Middle East is a large area of land in the eastern hemisphere. The lands of the Arabian Peninsula and some of the lands of the eastern Mediterranean are part of the Middle East. The Middle East's population is mostly Muslim. The name of the Middle East comes from its position to the east of Europe and to the west of the Far East. Now, parts of ancient civilizations began in the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East. These were Sumer, Babylonia and Assyria in the area called Mesopotamia. The Abrahamic religions that believe in one God also originated in the Middle East.
Warsaw: Warsaw (In Polish: Warszawa) is the capital of Poland in Masovian Voivodeship. It is also the biggest city in that country. There are about 2,000,000 people living there (1,726,581 as of 31 March 2014). People from Warsaw are called "Varsovians". There are other names for Warsaw. For example, (Latin, Spanish) and Varsóvia (Portuguese), (French), (Italian), (German, Dutch), /Varshe (Yiddish), (Lithuanian), (Hungarian) and Varšava (Czech)
Hindu–Arabic numeral system: The Hindu–Arabic numeral system, sometimes known as the Indo–Arabic numeral or Latin numeral system or simply the Hindu numeral system, Indo numeral system or Arabic numeral system, is a system of numbers used all around the world. It is a base-ten place-value system. This system has ten basic lowercase-only symbols, which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. The Hindu–Arabic numeral system was first created by the Indians in the 6th century and used by the Arabs in the 7th century and Romans in the 16th century.
Point (geometry): A point is a position in space which has no size, but which does have position. In geometry, a point has no size, but has a position. This means it has no volume, area or length. We usually draw a point as a small cross 'X' or a small dot (a small, round shape). Different points can be labelled using capital letters (A, B, C...X, Y, Z). The point is one of the most fundamental ideas in geometry. Two points form a line segment. When part of a line segment, the points are called its vertices. All polytopes are made of vertices.
Line: A line is the path of one point that is moving. A line is a type of geometric figure. A line has length, but no width. A line is made up of an endless number of points.
Plane (mathematics): space]] A plane is a perfectly flat surface extending in all directions. It can be thought of as the ceiling of a room, only extended into all directions infinitely. A plane has two dimensions: length and width. All planes are flat surfaces. If a surface is not flat, it is called a curved surface. The tool plane can be used to create a flat, level surface like the mathematical plane—hence the name. In geometry, a plane is made up of an infinite number of lines (or points). It has no depth. It is absolutely flat and infinitely large.
Angle: When two straight lines come together, they make an angle. The two lines are called the sides of the angle, and they meet at a point. A flat surface (called a plane) also forms an angle when it meets another. To represent an angle, Greek letter To measure the [[size of an angle, we use units called degrees. A degree is a standard unit and we use the symbol ° after a number to show that it is a number of degrees. We can use a decimal number or a Fraction (mathematics) In [[mathematics, angles can also be (and often are) measured in radians instead of degrees, by using the conversion factor 2\pi\mbox{ rad} = 360^\circ (for example, 22.

List of telescope types: Unit Telescopes Working as One]] Astronomical telescopes are divided into subgroups. All telescopes work by collecting electromagnetic radiation and focussing it into an image which may be seen or photographed. The purpose is to see things which are far away in the universe. The traditional types all work to collect visible light from the sky. Recent types may work outside the visible spectrum. They all have their different advantages and disadvantages and they are used in different areas of astronomy.

List of endangered languages: A list of endangered languages (with fewer than 1000 speakers or with very fast decline). In order to judge if a language is actually endangered, the number of speakers is less important than the distribution among age cohorts. There may be 200,000 mother tongue speakers of the Breton language over 50 years of age, but fewer than 2,000 under 25 years of age - thus it is likely Breton will die out in the next half century. On the other hand, while there are 30,000 Ladin language speakers left, almost all children still learn it as their mother tongue - thus Ladin is not endangered in the 21st century.

The sources for this information were the Yale Parallax Catalog [Y], Hipparcos [H], Soderhjelm 1999 [S], Tinney 1996 [T]. Stars move, and so distances are as at present only. Some 52 star systems beyond our own, the Solar System, lie within of the Sun. These systems contain 63 stars. 50 of these are red dwarfs, by far the most common type of star in the Milky Way.
List of galaxies: List of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Because there are so many galaxies in the universe, this list has been divided into several categories. The first catalog that catalogues galaxies is the Catalogue of Galaxies and of Clusters of Galaxies.
List of nearest galaxies: This list of the nearest galaxies to Earth is ordered by increasing distance. Many of the distances are only estimates, and some may be incorrect by 50% or more. The distance ranking in this list should be seen only as a guess. Distances are given in light years (ly).

List of comets: This is a list of some comets in the solar system. Periodic comets visit us again and again. Non-periodic comets visit us only once. On this list there is a "P" in front of the periodic comets. In front of non-periodic comets there is a "C". There is sometimes a number in front of the "P": it shows the number of times people saw the periodic comet visiting us.
List of stars with confirmed extrasolar planets: The following is a list of main sequence stars with confirmed extrasolar planets. Note that the masses of the planets are lower bounds only. If a planet is detected by the spectral line displacement method referred to above, no information is gained about the inclination of the planet's plane of orbit around its star, and a value for this is needed to calculate the mass. It has become customary to arbitrarily assume that the plane is exactly lined up with the line of sight from Earth (this produces the lowest possible mass consistent with the spectral line measurements).
List of water sports: Many sports are played in water. The following is a list of water sports, divided by category. This list is not complete. Some of the sports include only one part to swimming, as for example Triathlon.

This list includes quite a few masts. A mast is a man-made support structure, commonly used on sailing ships as support for sails, or on ...
Acid: (in beaker) reacting with ammonia fumes to produce ammonium chloride (white smoke).]] An acid is a type of chemical compound. The definition of an acid has changed as people discovered more about chemistry. Acids were originally grouped together by their properties: they taste sour, change the color of litmus paper to red, and make salt (chemistry) There are two main definitions of acid used by [[chemists today. A Brønsted–Lowry acid is a chemical that can donate a hydrogen ion () (generally speaking, this will be a proton) to another substance.
White dwarf: taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. Sirius B, which is a white dwarf, can be seen as a faint pinprick of light to the lower left of the much brighter Sirius A]] A white dwarf is a compact star. Their matter is squashed together. Gravitation has pulled the atoms close together, and taken off their electrons. The mass of a white dwarf is similar to the mass of the Sun, but its volume is similar to that of the Earth. White dwarfs are the final stellar evolution The material in a white dwarf no longer undergoes [[fusion reactions, so the star has no source of energy.
Beach: and shingle beach in Dorset, England]] , France]] , Amblyrhynchus cristatus, on the beach at Tortuga Bay on Santa Cruz Island, Galapagos]] A beach is a landform along the coast of an ocean, sea, lake, or river. It usually consists of loose particles, such as sand, gravel, shingle, or pebbles. The particles of a beach are sometimes biological in origin, such as mollusc shells or bits of coral and sometimes bits of igneous rock, but the most common mineral in beaches is quartz. Beaches are natural landing and launching places for boats, and landing craft are specially made for beaches.
Mental illness: A mental illness is an illness of the mind. It can be a psychiatric disorder, a psychological disorder, mental disease, mental breakdown, nervous breakdown, or mental health lunatics. People with a mental illness may behave in strange ways, or have strange thoughts. Mental illnesses can create problems for what a person has to do every day. Mental illnesses develop during the life of a person. This may be linked to genes and experience. What people call mental illness has changed over time. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) by the American Psychiatric Association is used around the world.

The majority involve a car but there are also many bus, truck and bicycle accidents.
Acne: Acne is an infection of the skin, caused by changes in the sebaceous glands. The most common form of acne is called acne vulgaris, which means "common acne". The redness comes from the inflammation of the skin in response to the infection. Oils from the glands combine with dead skin cells to block hair follicles. Under the blocked pore, oil builds up. Skin bacteria can then grow very quickly. This infection makes the skin become swollen and red, which becomes visible. The face, chest, back, and upper arms are most common places for acne to happen.
Dinosaur: Dinosaurs are a group of Archosaur reptiles of the clade Dinosauria. Dinosaurs eventually gave rise to birds. Dinosaurs were the most powerful land animals of the Mesozoic era. Over 500 different genera of dinosaurs are known. Fossils of dinosaurs have been found on every continent. Dinosaurs evolved in the Upper Triassic, about 230 million years ago (mya). The earliest date of a fossil is that of Eoraptor and Herrerasaurus from Argentina, and Saturnalia from Brazil, 237 to 228 mya. By the early Jurassic they were the top land vertebrates, and dominated most environments on land.

DNA, present in most cells such as skin, muscle, and nerve cells, contains the genetic instructions that cells use to make proteins, but it is absent in some cells like mature red blood cells.
Karl Marx: Karl Marx (5 May 1818 in Trier, Prussia – 14 March 1883 in London, England) was a German political thinker who wrote about economics and politics. Marx thought that human societies develop through class struggle. Marx believed that no economic class—wage workers, land owners, etc. should have power over another. He believed that everyone should contribute what they can, and everyone should get what they need. His most famous book was the Communist Manifesto. He wrote it with Friedrich Engels in 1848. The book is about the ideas and aims of communism. His ideas are called Marxism.

Volcano: erupting on May 18, 1980]] peninsula, eastern Russia]] A volcano is a mountain that has lava (hot, liquid rock) coming out from a magma chamber under the ground, or did have in the past. Volcanoes are formed by the movement of tectonic plates. Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the crust's plates, e.g., in the East African Rift. Volcanoes are not typically found where two tectonic plates slide past one another. Volcanism away from plate boundaries is caused by mantle plumes.
Big Bang: about how the universe started expanding, and then made the stars and galaxy The most commonly considered alternatives are called the [[Steady State theory and Plasma cosmology, according to both of which the universe has no beginning or end. According to the theory the Big Bang began as a very hot, small, and dense superforce (the mix of the four fundamental forces), with no stars, atoms, form, or structure (called a "singularity"). Then about 13.8 space expanded very quickly (thus the name "Big Bang").

Observational astronomers work in observatories with telescopes to collect information from things in outer space such as planets, stars, or galaxies. Theoretical astronomers study the collected information, and use it to help us understand how the universe behaves.
Analysis: Analysis is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance into smaller parts to gain a better understanding of it. The technique has been applied in the study of mathematics and logic since before Aristotle (384–322 B.C.), though analysis as a formal concept is a relatively recent development. The word comes from the Ancient Greek ἀνάλυσις (analusis, "a breaking up", from ana- "up, throughout" and lysis "a loosening"). In this context, Analysis is the opposite of synthesis, which is to bring ideas together.
Foolishness: —from his fresco of seven virtues and their opposite vices. Stultitia (folly) was shown as the opposite of Prudentia (prudence).]] Foolishness is when someone acts without wisdom or sense. A foolish decision is one made without careful reasoning or judgement. An act of foolishness is called folly. A person who shows foolishness may be called a fool. It is different to stupidity, which is the lack of intelligence. A fool's errand is a useless piece of work. A fool's paradise a happy state for which there is no good reason.

Carl Sagan: Carl Edward Sagan (November 9, 1934 &ndash; December 20, 1996) was an American astronomer. He was very interested in what extraterrestrial life on other planets would be like, which is known as SETI (Search for extraterrestrial intelligence). Sagan was a science communicator, which meant he taught people about science. He felt like the general public was losing interest in science, so he wrote many books and appeared on television to make it popular again. He mostly talked about planetary science and topics related to outer space.
Matsuo Basho: .]] Matsuo Munefusa, known as Matsuo Bashō (, 1644 - November 28, 1694) was a Japanese poet. He is known as the greatest maker of haiku, a kind of poetry with 17 syllables. The Japanese written language was difficult to master, but haiku was easy for him to write. Matsuo's haikus included characteristics of nature and the four seasons. The reader has to use their imagination to understand his poems. First he named himself Tosei (桃青) meaning "unripe peach in blue". Basho took this name because he admired a Chinese poet, Li Po whose name means plum in white.
Colonization: Colonization is the act of the people of a country settling in another area or country to rule the place. An early example is the settlers who went from the cities of Ancient Greece to start new cities. In 1492, Christopher Columbus landed in the Americas. This is how the Europeans learned that North America and South America were there. The Europeans colonized the Americas. Because of this, and the killing of many Native Americans, most people now living in North America are mostly descendants of Europeans.

It lies at the southern edge of the Sahara Desert The Sahel has a tropical semi-arid climate. It is between the dry desert land to the north and the forest areas to the south. The temperature is high throughout the year. There is little rainfall in the Sahel (between 100 and 150&nbsp;mm and 600mm). It comes during summer months and may be unreliable. It may be very dry in some years, especially if a large area of low pressure, which brings rain, is not carried North over the Sahel by strong winds.
Chemical change: A chemical change (chemical reaction) is a change of materials into other materials with different properties. Chemical changes occur when a substance combines with another to form a new substance, or, chemical decomposition into two or more different substances. These processes are called chemical reactions. Burning of wood is a chemical change as new substances which cannot be changed back (e.g. carbon dioxide) are formed. For example, if wood is burned in a fireplace, there is not wood anymore but ash.
Physical change: A physical change is a type of change in which the form of matter is altered but one substance is not transformed into another. The size or shape of matter may be changed, but no chemical reaction occurs. All physical changes are reversible and their mass does not change. Some examples are changes of shape, changes of states, and passing electricity through a copper wire. Physical changes could be: melting, freezing, boiling/evaporating, condensing, deposition and sublimation. Many physical changes also involve the rearrangement of atoms most noticeably in the formation of crystals.

Cytokine: Cytokines are a group of signalling molecules made by cells. They help to control the immune system and fight disease. They are similar to hormones and, as we learn more about each, distinctions between the two are fading. Cytokines carry signals locally between cells, and these signals have an effect on other cells. They are made of proteins, peptides, or glycoproteins. The cytokines are a large family of polypeptide regulators that are produced throughout the body by many groups of cells. Some well-known cytokines include interferon, prostaglandin and interleukins.

For example, one song, "Padraic My Prince", tells the fictional story of a mother drowning her son in a bathtub. In interviews, Oberst has said that he sings about such things to make rich emotions.
Honeycomb: A honeycomb is a container made by bees out of wax that they produce. The bees make a honeycomb as a place to keep their honey. Bees make honey from nectar that they collect from flowers. After bees collect nectar from flowers, and make it into honey, the bees then put the honey in the small six sided areas of the honeycomb. Each hexagonal section tessellates with the rest.
Greek language: The Greek language, also referred to as the Grecian language, is an Indo-European language that is the official language of Greece (Hellas) and Cyprus. It was first spoken in Greece and was also once spoken along the coast of Asia Minor (now part of Turkey) and in southern Italy. It also used to be widely used in Western Asia and North Africa. In Greek, the language is called Ελληνικά (Elliniká). The language is written using the Greek alphabet. The Latin alphabet, which is used in writing English and many other languages, came indirectly from the Greek alphabet through the Etruscan alphabet.

Pepsin: Pepsin is an enzyme. It acts on proteins in the stomach, which has a low pH because of the Hydrochloric acid. It works best at a pH of about 1.5. It will not work at a pH above 6. It was the first animal enzyme to be discovered. Theodor Schwann discovered it in 1836. Pepsin is used to make cheese.
PH: pH is a scale of acidity from 0 to 14. It tells how acidic or alkaline a substance is. More acidic solutions have lower pH. More alkaline solutions have higher pH. Substances that aren't acidic or alkaline (that is, neutral solutions) usually have a pH of 7. Acids have a pH that is less than 7. Alkalis have a pH that is greater than 7. pH is a measure of the concentration of protons (H+) in a solution. S.P.L. Sørensen introduced this concept in the year 1909. The p stands for the German potenz, meaning power or concentration, and the H for the hydrogen ion (H+).
Tapeworm: Tapeworms are the class Cestoda of segmented flatworms (Platyhelminthes).They are parasitic, which means that they need another larger creature as a host. Tapeworms live inside the intestines of vertebrate animals. This includes humans. When a vertebrate has a tapeworm, they may lose weight and become weaker. Tapeworms can be up to 30 or 36&nbsp;feet (10–12&nbsp;metres) long. They eat by absorbing material directly through their epidermis (outside layer). The head of a tapeworm has four suckers and two rings of hooks.
Omnivore: s, dogs, pigs, catfish, crow, meat ant]] An omnivore is an animal whose species gets its energy and nutrients from a diet made up of foods that include plants, animals, algae, fungi and bacteria. Many omnivores change their eating habits during their life cycle. They are sometimes called "life-history omnivores", because they are only omnivores if their whole life is considered. Some species, such as grazing waterfowl like geese, are known to eat mainly animals at one stage of their lives, but plants at another.
Herbivore: Herbivores are animals that only eat plants. They are herbivorous animals. Most modern herbivores (such as deer, elephants, horses) are grazers with teeth that are adapted to grind grass. The main present-day vegetation in most continents is grassland. Some herbivorous animals do eat eggs and sometimes other animal protein. Animals who eat mainly fruit are called frugivores. Browsers eat mostly leaves and sometimes small tree branches. Animals that eat mostly grass are grazing animals. The diet of some herbivorous animals changes with the season.

Julius Caesar: Gaius Julius Caesar (12 July 100 BC – 15 March 44 BC) was a military commander, politician and author at the end of the Roman Republic. Caesar became a member of the First Triumvirate. When that broke up, he fought a civil war against Pompey the Great. Winning the war, Caesar became Roman dictator until his death. On March 15, 44 BC, he was stabbed to death by a group of senators on the Ides of March before a meeting of the Senate at the Curia of Pompey (the Theatre of Pompey) in Rome. Caesar is considered by many historians to be one of the greatest military commanders.

Hernán Cortés: Hernán Cortés (1485 - 2 December 1547) was an explorer and Conquistador from Spain. Between 1519 and 1521, he conquered the Aztec Empire of emperor Montezuma II where Mexico is today. He introduced vanilla and chocolate to Europe.
Bible study: Bible study is intensive reading of the Bible. For some Christians, study of the Bible is part of daily life. Many non-Christians also read the Bible, because it is an important piece of world literature. In Europe before the 16th century, most people could not study the Bible. Books were written only in Latin and Greek. Only people who had learned to read those languages could study the Bible. At the time, the Roman Catholic Church did not allow people to translate the Bible into other languages, like Italian or English.
Medlar: The medlar is a tree and the name of the fruit of this tree. Its Latin name is Crataegus germanica, or "German medlar", but it is not from Germany. It grows in the Near East and South-Eastern Europe, and the Romans took it to Germany. Near the Caspian Sea, people grew the medlar about three thousand years ago. It came to Greece in about 700 BC and to Rome in about 200 BC. It was an important fruit plant in Roman and medieval times. But by 1600-1700, people started eating other fruits and not the medlar.
Atheism: , a supporter of atheism, as well as the author of the well-known book The God Delusion]] Atheism is the idea that rejects the belief in a God or gods. It is the opposite of theism, which is the belief that at least one god exists. A person who rejects belief in gods is called an atheist. Adding an a, meaning "without", before the word theism results in atheism, or literally, "without theism". Atheism is not the same as agnosticism: agnostics say that there is no way to know whether gods exist or not.
Hippocrates: Hippocrates (c. 460 – c. 370 BC) was a Greek scientific reasons. Previously, people believed that disease was caused by angry gods. Many of Hippocrates' writings are still important to doctors. For example, patient confidentiality, meaning that doctors can only discuss a patient with the patient themselves. Another of his ideas is to never knowingly lead a patient to suffering or death. These kinds of ideas are part of medical ethics. The Hippocratic Oath is named after him. This is a set of rules which doctors promise to obey.
Commensurability: Commensurability is a concept in the philosophy of science. Scientific theories are described as commensurable if one can compare them to find out which is more accurate. If there is no way one can compare them to determine which is more accurate, they are incommensurable. Behind this is the idea that it is possible to see the world in multiple ways, and that there is not one fair method to see which way is right. Some think that scientific traditions (or paradigms) can be incommensurable: it is not really possible to say which one is right.
Harvest: image]] To harvest means to collect what has been planted and grown in the ground. It is usually done by farmers. They can do this by picking crops. Crop failure (also known as harvest failure) is a loss or reduced crop yield due to plants being damaged, killed, or destroyed. Sometimes it brings famine. "Harvest" can also mean to collect other things than plants such as cultivated bivalves including oysters, scallops, and other animals.
ELISPOT: ELISPOT stands for "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Spot Assay". It is a laboratory technique for detecting cells that make (or "secrete") various substances. These substances include specific types of cytokines or antibodies. The ELISPOT method is typically used with blood cells, and is a helpful tool in studying the human immune system and various treatments for disease (e.g. vaccines). In the ELISPOT technique, tiny wells are used to contain the cells, with a variety of other substances. The substances cause colored spots to form near the cells that secrete the substances in question.
Aztecs: , also known as the Aztec Calendar Stone, at the National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City]] The Aztecs were Native American people who lived in Mesoamerica. They ruled the Aztec Empire from the 14th century to the 16th century. The name "Aztec" comes from the phrase "people from Aztlan". Legends say that Aztlan was the first place the Aztecs ever lived. "Aztlan" means "place of the herons" in the Nahuatl language.p.&nbsp;8 Often the term "Aztec" refers just to the people of Tenochtitlan. This was a city on an island in Lake Texcoco.
Billion: Billion is a name for a large number. There are two different meanings for the term: * 1,000,000,000 (, one thousand million) is the short scale definition. It is used in both British and American English. The short scale has been used in the United Kingdom since 1974. Its prefix is “giga-“. * 1,000,000,000,000 (, one million million) is the long scale definition. It was formerly used in the United Kingdom. It is currently in some other countries. When “billion” has this meaning, the word “milliard” can be used for “thousand million”.
Richard Nixon: Richard Milhous Nixon (January 9, 1913 – April 22, 1994) was an American politician who was the 37th president of the United States from 1969 to 1974, when he became the only president to resign. Before that, Nixon was the 36th vice president (from 1953 to 1961 under President Dwight D. Eisenhower), and a U.S. Representative and Senator from California. He was a Republican. Nixon was born in Yorba Linda, California. He attended Duke University and graduated from its law school in 1937. After graduating, he returned to California to practice law.
Gerald Ford: Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr. (born Leslie Lynch King, Jr.; July 14, 1913 — December 26, 2006) was an American politician who had served as the 38th president of the United States from 1974 to 1977. Before becoming president, he was the 40th vice president from 1973 to 1974 under Richard Nixon. As a member of the Republican Party, he was also a member of the House of Representatives from 1949 to 1973, becoming its minority leader in 1965. He is the only president who elected to neither office as vice president or president.
John Kerry: John Forbes Kerry KCMG (born December 11, 1943) is an American politician. He is a former United States Secretary of State and former Senator from Massachusetts and the Democratic nominee for president in 2004. He lost to George W. Bush. He has served in the Senate for 23 years and has also served as the lieutenant governor of Massachusetts under Michael Dukakis. In November 2020, then President-elect Joe Biden named Kerry as the U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate. He resigned in early 2024 to help with Biden's re-election campaign.
White blood cell: in schematic]] in schematic]] in schematic]] The job of white blood cells (also called leukocytes) is to fight infections and cancer. They also remove poison, waste and damaged cells from the body. The number of white blood cells increases when a person is fighting infection or disease and decrease when a person is healthy.
Lymphocyte: (SEM) image of a single human lymphocyte.]] Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell (or leukocyte). They help an organism to fight infections. They occur in the immune system of all vertebrates. All lymphoctes have a large, blob-like nucleus. Lymphocytes can be divided into three main types: *large granular lymphocytes: these are part of the innate immune system, and are natural killer cells. *small lymphocytes: these lymphocytes are the main agents of the acquired immune system. The two main types are: **T cells and **B cells.
Author: An author is a person who makes an original piece of work. Most people use author to mean writer. While a writer is a type of author, authors often do more than write. Anyone who creates something original is an author. These could be written items such as books, stories, or poems. This could also be other types of art, such as sculpture or music. Any type of work can be made by an author.
Pedipalp: with pedipalps in green]] Pedipalps are the two appendages on the front of a spider's head. Other arachnids, and chelicerates that are not arachnids also have pedipalps. Some spiders seem to have ten legs and not eight, because these pedipalps look like an extra pair of legs. The pedipalps are used rather like arms. Spiders often use them to hold insects (for example crickets) for them to eat. Male spiders also use pedipalps for mating. The male spiders make some silk, put sperm onto the silk, and then put their pedipalps into the sperm.
Ionic compound: structure of sodium chloride, NaCl, a typical ionic compound. The purple spheres are sodium cations, Na+, and the green spheres are chloride anions, Cl−.]] In chemistry, an ionic compound is a compound made of ions. They have strong ionic bonds between particles. Lots of energy (heat) is required to break the bond apart, resulting in high melting and boiling points. The ions join because they have different charges. Compounds of metals and non-metals are usually ionic. They are made when two or more atoms come close together and an electron goes from one atom to the other atom.
ELISA: The ELISA method (Enzyme Linked Immuno-Sorbent Assay) is a technique used in biochemistry to determine if a certain substance--such as a specific cytokine or antigen--is present within a sample. It is sometimes abbreviated as "EIA." This technique uses special antibodies that attach themselves to the substance. These antibodies generate a specific color. The amount of color indicates the amount of substance present. (Sometimes, the substance must be viewed under ultraviolet light for the antibodies to generate this color.
David Hume: . The image is in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery]] David Hume (7 May 1711 When he was still alive, people thought of him as a historian. He wrote a series of large books called The History of England. But today, people think of Hume as an important philosopher.
Bath: A bath (UK English) or bathtub (US English) is a basin large enough for people sit in when washing their body. The bath is usually in the bathroom. A less common name for a bath is a washtub.it can be painted with whiter color, a [https://listbyamazon.com/top-trending-bathtub-paint/ painted bathtub] have long life. Sometimes people will add scents, oils and salts to the bath for better experience and relaxation. A bath is also a place where people can sit in water (or other liquids, often hot) for their health.
Brush: A brush is a tool with bristles or wires or other filaments sticking out. There are many kinds. Most brushes have a long part at one end to hold (the handle), on the other end from the head that carries the bristles or filaments. We use brushes for cleaning, making hair look good, painting, and other purposes.
Starch: , a pancake made from cassava and starch]] Starch is a complex carbohydrate. It is made of many glucose units joined by chemical bonds. This polysaccharide is produced by most green plants as an energy store. It is the most common carbohydrate in human diets. Pasta, potatoes, bread, and other starchy foods are made out of carbohydrates.
Thomas Hobbes: Thomas Hobbes (5 April 1588 – 4 December 1679) was a philosopher from England. His most famous book is Leviathan (1651).
Trevi: Trevi (Latin: Trebiae), an old town and comune of Italy, in the province of Perugia in east central Umbria, 42°53N 12°45E, at 424&nbsp;meters (1391&nbsp;ft) above sea-level on the lower part of Mt. Serano above the wide plain of the Clitunno river. It is 10&nbsp;km (6&nbsp;mi) S.S.E. of Foligno and 20&nbsp;km (12&nbsp;mi) N. of Spoleto. The 2003 count of people by the government said that there were 7800 people living in the comune: about half of the people live in the town and the other people live in the country near town.
Nicomachus: Nicomachos or Nicomachus is a Greek name. It can mean: *Nicomachus of Gerasa, an ancient mathematician *Nicomachus, the father of Aristotle and court physician (doctor) to King Amyntas III of Macedon. Nicomachus died when Aristotle was about 10. Nicomachus wanted Aristotle to follow in his footsteps. But Aristotle did not become a doctor but a philosopher. This is a unique name (not in the top 1000 newborn names in the US in 2021).
Logo: 's logo]] ]] A logo is a picture or drawing that is used by a person, group, or company to mark who they are. A wordmark, or 'logotype', is a logo made entirely of a word or words. It is usually the name of a product or organisation. A company or group can use a 'logo' on the things that they make, like on the things they sell, on letters, and in advertisements. When a person sees the logo picture, that person knows that the thing they see the logo on came from that company. Logos can have letters and words in them.
Picture: the environment with a mobile phone camera. The display of the mobile phone shows a live display of the image.]] A picture, also called an image, is a group of coloured points on a flat surface that looks the same as something else. For example, a picture can look the same as an object or a person. Pictures can also be drawings, paintings or photographs. People who make such pictures are called artists, photographers or painters. Pictures are very helpful. Sometimes people say pictures are worth a thousand words.
Building: .]] A building is an enclosed structure, particularly one constructed of solid materials, with some kind of roof and walls. Architects design different types for different purposes: Residential buildings are constructed as dwellings. These are where people primarily sleep and do other domestic activities. Examples include apartment blocks and houses. Commercial buildings are for operating businesses in. Examples include restaurants, stores and office buildings. Mixed-use buildings combine two or more different uses in a single structure.
Candle: A candle is a stick made of wax with a string (a thin piece of rope) straight in the middle. If someone puts the string on fire, the flame burns slowly but for a long time. Fire can burn string very fast. But in a candle, the string does not burn fast, because the fire melts the wax instead. The wax sometimes drips down the side of the candle. When the melted wax is far from the flame, it gets hard again, and can be used again in a new candle. The flame is very hot, since it is a very small, real fire.
Salamander: Salamanders are amphibians. They are the order Caudata (or Urodela). There are about 500 different species. Salamanders live in water and on land, and look rather like lizards, with four legs and a tail. They hatch as larvae from eggs in the water. At that stage, they have gills that stick out. Most salamanders live on land when they are adults, after their change of shape (metamorphosis). On land, salamanders live in moist habitats. Their method of respiration varies. Some salamanders stay in the water, but look like adults.
Newt: colouration warns predators of its highly toxic skin.]] Newts or efts are small amphibia. They are in a subfamily of the salamanders. They are found in North America, Europe, and North Asia.
Poison: Poisons are substances which cause death or injury when taken in by a living thing. It may be taken in as drink or food, or absorbed through the skin. The damage is usually done by a chemical reaction. The effect of the poison varies with the amount which is absorbed (taken in or inhaled). Substances which are poisonous are called toxic, but any substance can be toxic if too much of it is consumed. If poisoning causes death, it is lethal poison. Legally, and in hazardous chemical labeling, poisons are especially toxic substances.
Powder: ]] Powder is very small, dry pieces or grains. When we press some dry solids very hard, or when we cut something up into lots of small pieces, we can sometimes make powder. For example, people sometimes put face powder on their faces, when they want to look good. Sometimes sports players put powder on their hands, to make them dry. We put curry powder in our food, to make it taste stronger. We put washing powder in the washing machine when we want to have clean clothes. People use gunpowder to make bombs and fireworks. "Powder" is also a verb - meaning to apply powder.
Larva: Many animals develop in separate stages. A larva (plural: larvae) develops from the egg in those animals. It is a separate life stage from the adult reproductive stage. A larva does not look like the adult animal, and changes shape (known as metamorphosis) as it grows up. There may be several larval stages before the adult form. Tadpoles, maggots and caterpillars are larvae. Marine organisms with a larval stage often release large numbers of eggs and sperms into the water column. After fertilisation, the eggs develop into tiny larvae.
Amphibian: , typical of the large-size early amphibians 310–295 million years ago]] Amphibians are members of the class Amphibia. The living ones are frogs (including toads), salamanders (including newts) and caecilians. They are four-legged vertebrates which are cold blooded. Amphibians lay their eggs in water, usually in a foam nest. After hatching they are tadpoles, which live in the water and have gills. The tadpoles change into adults in a process called metamorphosis. When they are adult, they have lungs to breathe instead of gills, and legs.
Father: ]] A father (also called dad or daddy) is a male parent. Most human beings are born from a mother and a father. The father of a person's husband or wife is their father-in-law. Fathers determine the gender of their child through a sperm cell which either contains an X chromosome (female), or Y chromosome (male).
Gill: (a type of amphibian)]]]] Gills are what fish, amphibians, and some other animals use to breathe in water. They have feathery parts which cause water to move across the animal's body, which contains dissolved oxygen, after the animal has swallowed the water. The oxygen is absorbed into the animal's blood, causing carbon dioxide to move out of the animal's blood and into the water through the gills. Fish and frog gills are hidden on the sides of their heads. Sharks have many gills slits on their necks.
Frog: Frogs are amphibians and vertebrates of the order Anura. There is not much difference between frogs and toads, and they are not classified separately. This is because the toad lifestyle, with its dry, rough, skin, is an adaptation to living in drier habitats. The toad form has evolved a number of times independently, an example of convergent evolution. Frogs can live on land and in fresh water. They cannot survive in salt water. Their development is by metamorphosis. They usually hatch as tadpoles from eggs, which are laid by a female frog.
Chemical compound: A chemical compound is a substance made of two or more different elements joined together by chemical bonds in a fixed ratio. Many compounds are made of separate molecules. Each molecule has the same number and types of atoms. For example, every water molecule has two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Other compounds do not have separate molecules. Instead, their atoms are arranged in a large, repeating network. For example, sodium chloride (table salt) is made of equal numbers of sodium and chlorine atoms, but they are all connected in a big crystal structure.
Wood: Wood is what keeps trees and shrubs upright, and what transports water from the roots to the leaves. The two main chemical substances in wood are cellulose and lignin. Wood is formed in trees and shrubs by the cambium, a cell layer between bark and wood. The result is that wood is formed in circular rings, which are called growth rings. The wood in the centre of the tree or shrub may have a different color from that on the outside. In that case, the wood on the outside is light in color, and is called "sapwood"; the wood in the centre is darker in color, and is called "heartwood".
Chalk: s in Sussex]] chalk]] Chalk is a type of limestone. It was made by calcareous (CaCO3) skeletons of tiny planktonic algae called coccoliths. They live in the sea in huge numbers. They make chalk (CO2) as a by-product of their photosynthesis. The chalk cliffs of Dover and elsewhere were made when England was below the equator in a tropical sea. It was in the Upper Cretaceous, when the Earth was even warmer than now. There are coccoliths today, but not the same species as formed the white cliffs. Air and water do not wear chalk away easily, so when chalk is next to the sea, it often makes a large cliff.
Utilitarianism: was a main utilitarian philosopher of the 18th and 19th centuries|thumb]] Utilitarianism is the view that the right thing to do is whatever is most useful. It is a about ethics. The word "utilitarianism" comes from the word "utility", which means "usefulness". In most forms of utilitarianism, things that increase human well-being or happiness are called useful. This is not limited to the happiness caused by a single action but also includes the happiness of all people involved and all future consequences.
Village: , a village in West Java, Indonesia]] A village is a place where people live, normally in the countryside. It is usually larger than a hamlet and smaller than a town or city. In some places, it may be a kind of local government. The dwellings in a village are clustered fairly near one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape. In the past, villages were where most people lived. Villages were a usual form of community for societies that do subsistence agriculture, and for some non-agricultural societies.
Chelmsford: Chelmsford a city in the county of Essex, England. It is northeast of London, about halfway to Colchester. It is nearly in the centre of the county and it is the county town of Essex, but it is not the biggest or the oldest town in the county. It is the centre of the borough of Chelmsford, which is a bigger place than the city. Chelmsford has the smallest cathedral in England. John Dee, who wrote the English version of Euclid, went to the Cathedral school in the sixteenth century. Chelmsford is also home to some of the Anglia Ruskin University campuses.
Gangnihessou: Do-Aklin or Gangnihessou (Ganye Hessou) or Dogbari was the first of twelve kings of Dahomey in Africa. Gangnihessou might have been the king around the year 1620. One of his symbols was a bird called "gangnihessou" after his name. His other symbols were a drum, and sticks used for throwing or hunting. He had a younger brother called Dakodonou, who was a king. Some historians think Gangnihessou was not actually a king. Instead, Gangnihessou might have led people by giving advice to his brother. of Africa and queens births deaths people
Contract bridge: Contract bridge, or just bridge, is a trick-taking card game. It is played by two pairs of players, one pair against the other pair. Partners sit opposite each other at a table. In face-to-face games, a convenient table size is from 32 to 40 inches (80 to 100 centimeters) square. The table is usually covered by green baize cloth. The point of the cloth is to stop cards skittering (sliding) across the table. In online computer play, players from anywhere in the world sit at a virtual table. Millions of people play bridge in clubs, tournaments, online and with friends at home.
No: No is an English word that has a negative meaning. It is the opposite of the word yes, which is a positive term. No is used when someone is turning away something. It is also used when opposing an idea. It can also be used in different figures of speech. In both sentences and talking, the words "No" and the word "Not" can both be used, though the word "No" is mainly used when speaking to other people. In some cases, however, "Not" is not acceptable, and vice versa. These words are not to be confused with the similar sounding words know and knot.
Leon Trotsky: Lev Davidovich Bronstein ( (; also transliterated Leo, Lev, Trotskii, Trotski, Trotskij and Trotzky; 26 October (N.S.), 1879 in Kropyvnytskyi (Russian Empire, now in Ukraine) - 21 August 1940 in Coyoacán, Mexico) was the pseudonym of Leib or Lev Davidovich Bronstein. He was a Russian revolutionary and political theoretician of Jewish-Ukrainian descent. After leading the Red Army in the Russian Civil War, he disagreed with other Bolsheviks,. had to leave Russia, and was later killed under Stalin's orders.
Second International: The Second International (1889–1916) was an organization created on July 14, 1889, by socialist and labour parties who wanted to work together for international socialism. It continued the work of the First International, which stopped being an organization in 1886. However, it did not include the still-powerful anarcho-syndicalist movement and trade unions. Among the Second International's most famous actions were its 1889 declaration of May 1 as International Labor Day and its 1910 declaration of March 8 as International Women's Day.
Devon: Devon is a county in South West England in the United Kingdom. It is sometimes called by its historical name Devonshire. Devon is the fourth largest county in England by area, and has the longest road network of any county in England. Its capital city and county town is Exeter, but the largest city is Plymouth.
Latin script: The Latin or Roman script is a writing system used to write many modern-day languages including English. It is the most used writing system in the world today. It is the official script for nearly all the languages of Western Europe and of some Eastern European languages. It is also used by some non-European languages such as Turkish, Vietnamese, Malay, Indonesian, Somali, Swahili and Tagalog. It is an alternative writing system for languages such as Serbian, Bosnian, Hindi and Chinese. The alphabet is a writing system which evolved from a western variety of the Greek alphabet.
Insectivore: eating a praying manitis]] An insectivore is an animal or insect that eats mostly insects for food. An anteater is an animal that eats ants. Insectivorous plants also eat insects. The Venus flytrap is one of them. To eat insects for food is not very easy because insects are small. Large insect-eating animals must eat many of them. Anteaters eat hundreds of ants every day. Some omnivores like humans and bears also eat insects for food. There was once a taxonomic group of mammals called Insectivora. Most of its animals are now called Eulipotyphla.
Copy: Copy means a thing that is made to look like another thing. *Copying, making a copy, the duplication of information **Photocopying, a process which makes paper copies of documents and other visual images **Fax, a telecommunications machine used to transfer copies of documents over the telephone network **Facsimile, a copy or reproduction that is as true to the original source as possible **Replica, a copy closely resembling the original concerning its shape and appearance *Copy (written), commonly used in newsrooms and publications to refer to a writer's written content English 850 words
Vapor: Vapor (British English: vapour) is when small drops of liquid float in the air. Sometimes this happens because the liquid has been heated. Vapor is not the same as gas. It is a mixture of liquid and gas. The usual word for this is steam.
Vehicle: A vehicle is a machine to move people and things. A vehicle is not alive. A horse can move people and things, but it is an animal, not a machine or a vehicle. The word vehicle is borrowed from French and Latin. French véhicule, going back to Middle French, borrowed from Medieval Latin vehiculum "medium, agent of transmission," going back to Latin, "wheeled vehicle, means of transport," from vehere "to carry, convey.

Shape: A shape is a geometric figure that can be made with mathematics. Shapes are sorted into kinds based on how the shape looks, and what the shape is made of. For example, shapes can be classified by how many dimensions they use. Two-dimensional shapes will fit into a flat plane. Three-dimensional objects will not fit inside a plane, because they are not flat. Shapes made from other shapes of any dimension are called polytopes. Two shapes are said to be equal, if one can be changed into the other by turning, moving, growing, shrinking, or more than one of these at once.

Electric charge: Electric charge is a basic property of electrons, protons and other subatomic particles. Electrons are negatively charged while protons are positively charged. Two or more particles with unlike charges attract each other and one with same type of charges repel each other. This makes electrons and protons stick together to form atoms. Charges are also conserved, that is intial charge on any body (bodies) is equal to final charges on them. These rules (or facts) are called the Law of Charges. The concept of electric charge and its behavior was first explored by Benjamin Franklin in the 18th century.

The set of all values that x can have is called the domain, and the set that contains every value that y can have is called the codomain. A function is often denoted by italic letters such as f, g, h. If this happens, then we say that y is a function of x, and we write y=f(x).

Boeing 737: {| |} The Boeing 737 is a twin-engine, narrow-body airliner built by Boeing. At first, Boeing was making it to be a shorter, cheaper airliner than its 707 and 727. However, the 737 has become a family of many different models. The number of passengers it can carry ranges from 85 to 215. The 737 is the only narrow-body airliner that Boeing is making. The only types of 737 that Boeing is still making are the -700, -800 and -900ER. A version of the 737 with larger engines, the 737 MAX, came into service in 2017 but was grounded between March 2019 and December 2020 as unsafe.
Tsar: Tsar is a title for the supreme ruler in several countries. In Bulgaria, the title was used in 913–1422 and again in 1908–1946. The last tsar to rule Bulgaria was Boris III, who replaced Ferdinand I of Bulgaria 1918. In Serbia, the title was used in 1346—1371. The last tsar to rule Serbia was Stephen Uroš V. In the Russian Empire, the title was used from 1546 until 1721. Starting in 1721, the title of Russian emperors was imperator, but the word tsar remained in common use until the Russian Revolution in 1917.
1550s: The 1550s was a decade that started on 1 January 1550 and ended on 31 December 1559. It is distinct from the decade known as the 156th decade which began on January 1, 1551 and ended on December 31, 1560.
Engelbert Dollfuss: Engelbert Dollfuss (German: Dollfuß) (October 4, 1892 – July 25, 1934) was the Chancellor of Austria from 1932 until 1933. He led the country as a dictator from early 1933 until 1934. He studied law in Vienna, and Economics in Berlin. During World War I, he served in the Alps and briefly became a prisoner of war in 1918. He became Chancellor on May 20, 1932 as head of a right-wing coalition government. He wanted to solve the problems caused by the Depression. He had problems finding majorities in parliament.
Language isolate: A language isolate is a language that is not known to be related to any other language. Many languages are related to other languages by coming from an older language, and both are still similar. Languages that are related are language families. Most languages are known to belong to a language family. However, some are not known to be related to other languages and are called language isolates. Some spoken language isolates are Basque, Zuni, Burushaski, Ainu and Mapudungun. Some extinct language isolates are Sumerian, Elamite and Urartian. isolates
Species: A species is a kind of organism. It is a basic unit of biological classification, and a formal rank in taxonomy. Originally, the word was used informally in a rather vague way, but now there are at least 26 different ways it is used. All animals or plants that are the same kind belong to the same species. Wolves (Canis lupus) are one species. Humans (Homo sapiens) are another species. Broadly, the idea is that, for example, cats breed with cats and produce more cats. This is the basis for deciding to have a species called Felis catus.
Ancestor: An ancestor is a person (or another organism or thing) from whom (or which) another is ancestor may be called an ancestress. The line of ancestors from which an organism descends is referred to as its ancestry. A second meaning relates to evolution. There, it is used of a species or group of species of animals or plants from which others have evolved. In a similar way, the word ancestor can be used for an early prototype or forerunner of a later device. No blood relationship is necessarily genetic relationship if one is the ancestor of the other, or if they share a common ancestor.
River dolphin: River dolphins are five species of dolphin which live in fresh water rivers and estuaries. Three species live in fresh water rivers. The La Plata Dolphin lives in salt water estuaries and the ocean. *South Asian river dolphins (two sub-species) **Ganges river dolphin, Platanista gangetica gangetica – Lives in Nepal, Republic of India and Bangladesh ** Indus river dolphin, Platanista indicus minor – Lives in Pakistan; National mammal of Pakistan. *South American river dolphins (three species) ** Amazon river dolphin (or Boto), Inia geoffrensis – Largest of river dolphins, lives in Peru and Brazil.
Estuary: An estuary is where a river meets the sea. There, saltwater mixes with freshwater. The river becomes wider and wider and flows slowly to the ocean. Bays, marshes, swamps, and inlets can all have estuaries. A view of an estuary from the air is usually an interesting sight: many estuaries meander (curve and bend) to find their way to the sea. Estuaries come in all sizes and shapes, each according to its location and climate. Where rivers meet the sea and fresh water mixes with salt water, the mixture is called brackish water.

Hooke played an important role in the birth of science in the 17th century with both experimental and theoretical work. He was a colleague of Robert Boyle and Christopher Wren, and a rival to Isaac Newton. Hooke was a leader in the plans to rebuild after the Great Fire of London in 1666. There is no surviving portrait of Hooke.
Emission: Emission is a word that originally comes from Latin. Originally it means something that is sent out. Several things can be sent out: * The most common use talks about emission of toxic gases. Those gases get produced by factories and motors, like motors in cars. * People talk about radio emissions. Those are programmes that people can listen to if they have a radio receiver. * There could be emissions of loud noise, someone might be making loud noises. * There also are emissions of light.

Mehmed II: Mehmed II (; , ; 30 March 14323 May 1481), commonly known as Mehmed the Conqueror (; ), was an Ottoman sultan who ruled from August 1444 to September 1446, and then later from February 1451 to May 1481. In Mehmed II's first reign, he defeated the crusade led by John Hunyadi after the Hungarian incursions into his country broke the conditions of the Peace of Szeged. When Mehmed II ascended the throne again in 1451, he strengthened the Ottoman navy and made preparations to attack Constantinople. At the age of 21, he conquered Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) and brought an end to the Byzantine Empire, permanently cementing its destruction.
The Bold and the Beautiful: The Bold and the Beautiful is a popular American soap opera. After The Young and the Restless, it is the highest-rated soap opera there. The series is shown in over 100 countries. About 300 million people watch it every day. This makes The Bold and the Beautiful the most watched television series in the world. The first episode was shown on March 23, 1987 on the CBS network. The series was created by the soap opera writer William J. Bell and his wife, Lee Phillip Bell. It is the only American soap opera to have its daily episodes translated into Spanish for the Hispanic viewers in the United States.
Primary color: Primary colors (or primary colours in Commonwealth English) are sets of colors that can be mixed to make a useful range of colors. The primary colors are those which cannot be made by mixing other colors in a given color space. For an additive color model, as in overlapping projected lights or in television and computer screens, the primary colors are red, green, and blue. For a subtractive color model, as in mixing of pigments or dyes for printing, the CMY(K) set of primaries is often used. In this system the primary colors are cyan, magenta, and yellow.
Umbilicus: The umbilicus (also called navel or bellybutton) is a place on the body of mammals that is left after a baby loses its umbilical cord. The umbilicus of humans is in the middle of the abdomen. It is usually only easy to see on humans, and is a thin line on many other mammals. In humans, they can be split into two different kinds, the kind that goes in (innie) and the kind that goes out (outie). Different people have different navels that can be different in size, shape, and looks, but these differences are not genetic (you do not get them from looks passed down in your family).
James Cook: , c. 1775, National Maritime Museum, Greenwich]] Captain James Cook, British explorer, navigator and cartographer. He sailed through the Pacific Ocean three times, mapped many areas and recorded several islands and coastlines on European maps for the first time. He was the first British sailor to visit both the east coast of Australia and the Hawaiian Islands. He made the first European maps of Newfoundland and New Zealand. He wrote extensively about all his discoveries. He sailed twice around the world.
Offside rule: The offside rule is one of the oldest football rules, but is still a much discussed rule. This is probably because of the relatively complicated set of provisions provided by the sport's law-making body, the IFAB for deciding if a player in an offside position is actually guilty of an offside offence by becoming involved in active play. It can also be a difficult decision for the referee or assistant referee to make as they need to watch the ball, the player playing the ball and also the attacker who is seeking to receive the ball at the same time.
Valentine's Day: s of Valentine's Day are heart shapes, roses, and Cupid with his arrows. Valentine's Day is named for the martyred Christian saint named Valentine. He was a bishop that performed marriages between forbidden couples. Valentine's Day is celebrated on February 14th since it is associated with the feast day of St. Valentine, a Christian martyr. Since the 14th century, Valentine's pairs are formed in England. English emigrants then took the Valentine's custom to the United States. After World War II, US soldiers brought this festival to Europe.
Canary Islands: The Canary Islands are an autonomous community of Spain located off the coast of Africa. Consisting of seven main islands and over 50 smaller islands and islets, this region has a volcanic origin which can be appreciated in every one of them, especially in Tenerife, where we can find El Teide. The autonomous community has two capital cities, of equal status: Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. The seven islands are: La Palma, La Gomera, El Hierro, Tenerife, Gran Canaria, Lanzarote, and Fuerteventura.

It is used in fluorescent lamps, flashbulbs, and as a wavelength standard. The metre used to be defined as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths in a vacuum of krypton gas. filled with Krypton]]
Noble gas: The noble gases are a group of elements that are all gases. These elements are all in group 18 of the periodic table. All of them are monoatomic, meaning each molecule is a single atom. They almost never react with other elements. This is because they have a full 8 electrons outer electron shell. There are six noble gases: * helium * neon * argon * krypton * xenon * radon All of these gases are found in air. They make up around 0.96% of the atmosphere. Noble gas compounds can be formed from noble gases.
Polonium: Polonium is a rare radioactive metalloid. It is chemical element 84 on the periodic table and its symbol is Po. It was discovered in 1898 by Marie and Pierre Curie. Polonium is highly unstable, radioactive and toxic. This makes it difficult to handle. It can be dangerous, even in very small amounts. One gram of Po will self-heat to a temperature of about . It also vaporizes easily. Polonium has 33 isotopes, and all of them are radioactive. It is a very rare element in nature because of its short half-life.
Bismuth: Bismuth is a chemical element. It is element 83 on the periodic table and its symbol is Bi. Its atomic mass is 209. It is only slightly radioactive. The radioactivity is minimal so it is typically seen as nonradioactive. Bismuth is only naturally found as one isotope, which is the almost nonradioactive one. Its radioactivity was predicted by scientists and proven by analyzing the metal. It is in Group 15 on the periodic table.
Transition metal: are in pink in the middle]] The transition metals are a group of metals that are found in the middle of the periodic table. The alkaline earth metals, beginning with beryllium are to the left and the boron group elements are to the right. The term "transition element" was invented for them in 1921. The atomic numbers of these metals are from 21 to 30, 39-48, 57, 72-80, 89 and 104-112. Many elements like Zn, Cd, Hg, La and Ac have a highly debatable position in the transition series of elements. La and Ac are also classed in the lanthanide series and actinide series respectively.
Osmium: Osmium is a chemical element. It is element number 76 on the periodic table. Its symbol is Os. There is not much osmium on earth. There is actually such a small amount that osmium is very expensive. Osmium is a metal and it does not react very much, and such a metal is known as a "noble metal". Osmium is the densest (heaviest for the same amount) element on the periodic table. It was discovered in 1804 by Smithson Tennant in London, England. He found it together with Iridium in a bit of Platinum, which he had dissolved in Aqua regia.

FTP: FTP, also known as File Transfer Protocol, is a communication protocol for the rapid, simple transmission of files across a network supporting the TCP/IP. This network is generally the Internet, or a local network. FTP is a way of accessing files on another computer. FTP uses the Client-Server architecture, meaning that there is a server, that holds the files, and does the authentication, and a client, or the end-user, who is accessing the files. The server listens on the network for connection requests from other computers.
Hypertext Transfer Protocol: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (usually abbreviated to HTTP) is a communications protocol. It is used to send and receive webpages and files on the internet. It was developed by Tim Berners-Lee and is now coordinated by the W3C. HTTP/1.1 is the most-used version today, and RFC 2616 completely explains how it should work. As of April 2023, about 39% of websites already work with the newest version, HTTP/3, which came out in 2022. HTTP/3 is faster for most webpages in the real world. It is faster than both HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1, sometimes more than three times as fast as HTTP/1.1.
Ethernet: Ethernet is a way of connecting computers together in a local area network or LAN. It has been the most widely used method of linking computers together in LANs since the 1990s. The basic idea of its design is that multiple computers have access to it and can send data at any time. This is comparatively easy to engineer. If two computers send data at the same time, a collision will occur. When this happens, the data sent is not usable. In general, both computers will stop sending, and wait a random amount of time, before they try again.
Obesity: of a girl presumed to have Prader–Willi syndrome]] countries]] Obesity is the condition of being much too heavy for one's height so that one's health is affected. In other words, it means to be too overweight. Also known as being fat. It is considered a disease and has been described as an epidemic. To know if a person is overweight, the body mass index (BMI) is calculated, by dividing the person's weight (in kilograms), by their height (in metres) squared (multiplied by itself). (This is only meaningful for adults who are fully grown, and should not be used for children.

Pancreas: The pancreas is an organ that makes hormones and enzymes to help digestion. The pancreas helps break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. The pancreas is behind the stomach and is on the left side of the human body. The part of the pancreas that makes hormones is called the Islets of Langerhans. The Islets of Langerhans are a small part (2%) of the total cells in the pancreas. The Islets of Langerhans change which chemical they make depending on how much of other chemicals are already in the blood.
Chloroplast: 11. plastidial DNA 12. plastoglobule (drop of lipids) ]] A chloroplast is a small organelle inside the cells of plants and algae. They absorb light to make sugar in a process called photosynthesis. The sugar can be stored in the form of starch. Chloroplasts contain the molecule chlorophyll, which absorbs sunlight for photosynthesis. In addition to chlorophyll, a chloroplast uses carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) to form sugar and gives off oxygen (O2). Chlorophyll is what gives green plants their green colour.
Chlorophyll: s of plant cells.]] -derived average sea surface chlorophyll for the period 1998 to 2006.]] Chlorophyll is a pigment that gives plants their green colour. Chlorophyll is a chemical in the chloroplasts of plants. It allows plants to absorb and use light. Energy from the light is used in photosynthesis to make glucose. This contains lots of stored energy which the plant needs to release. It does this through respiration. This energy is then used when the plant grows or repairs damage. Chlorophyll also makes the stem and leaf of the plant green.
Oak: The oak tree is a tree or shrub in the genus Quercus. There are about 500 living species. They are divided into subgenera. The common name "oak" may also appear in the names of species in related genera, such as Lithocarpus. Oaks have spirally arranged leaves, with rounded edges in many species; some have leaves with jagged edges or entire leaves with smooth margins. Many deciduous species do not drop dead leaves until the next Spring. In Spring, a single oak tree produces both male flowers (as catkins) and small female flowers.
Glucose: Glucose () is a simple carbohydrate, or sugar. It is one of several kinds of sugars. It is important because cells in an organism use it as a source of energy. Turning glucose into energy is called cellular respiration, which is done inside the cells of a living organism. Excess glucose is converted to fats and are stored in adipose tissues. Glucose is made by plants in a process called photosynthesis. It can also be made by animals in their liver or kidneys. Having the right amount of glucose available in a person's body is important.
Cellulose: of plants. It is the most abundant macromolecule and the most common organic compound on Earth. It is also a kind of fiber. Cellulose is a very complex carbohydrate, consisting of 3,000 or more glucose units. Cellulose was discovered by Anselme Payen in 1838. He isolated it from plant matter and determined its chemical formula.

The following game is Super Smash Bros. Brawl for the Wii.
Catalysis: to non-toxic carbon dioxide at room temperature. It can also remove formaldehyde from the air.]] Catalysis is the process of change in rate (speed) of a chemical reaction due to the help of a catalyst. Unlike other chemicals which take part in the reaction, a catalyst is not consumed by the reaction itself. A catalyst may participate in many chemical reactions. Catalysts that speed the reaction are called positive catalysts. Catalysts that slow the reaction are called negative catalysts, or inhibitors.
Hydrogen peroxide: of hydrogen peroxide. H is hydrogen and O is oxygen. The lines repsent the chemical bonds between the atoms.]] Hydrogen peroxide is a chemical compound. Its molecular formula is H2O2. It is used as a cleaner, and as hair bleach. In a concentration of 3% (meaning that there are 3 grams of hydrogen peroxide for 100 grams of a water solution), it can be used to treat wounds. Over time, it will slowly become oxygen gas and water through decomposition. Chemists often use hydrogen peroxide in chemical reactions.

Atomic mass: An atomic mass (symbol: ma) is the mass of a single atom of a chemical element. It includes the masses of the 3 subatomic particles that make up an atom: protons, neutrons and electrons. Atomic mass can be expressed in grams. However, because atoms are very small, this is not easy to do. Instead, atomic mass is expressed in kg. A carbon-12 atom has a mass of 12 u. Because electrons are so light, people can say that the mass of a carbon-17 atom is made of 6 protons and 6 neutrons. Because the masses of protons and neutrons are almost exactly the same, it can be said that both protons and neutrons have a mass of roughly 1 u.
Price: There are different definitions of price. Perhaps the simplest definition is to say "price is the value of a product (good) or service".

If the graph travelled has an Eulerian path, this circuit is the ideal solution.
Four color theorem: The four color theorem is a theorem of mathematics. It says that in any plane surface with regions in it (people think of them as maps), the regions can be colored with no more than four colors. Two regions that have a common border must not get the same color. They are called adjacent (next to each other) if they share a segment of the border, not just a point. This was the first theorem to be proved by a computer, in a proof by exhaustion. In proof by exhaustion, the conclusion is established by dividing it into cases, and proving each one separately.
Theorem: . Theorems are proved using logic and other theorems that have already been proved. A minor theorem that one must prove to prove a major theorem is called a lemma. Theorems are made of two parts: hypotheses and conclusions. Theorems use deduction, in contrast to theories which are empirical. Some theorems are trivial, since they directly follow from the propositions. Other theorems are called "deep", because their proof is long and difficult. Sometimes, such proofs involve other areas of mathematics or show connections between different areas.

A revision guide is a type of textbook that is used to remind the learner about the subject and give him/her extra practice, especially before an examination.
Axiom: An axiom is a concept in logic. It is a statement which is assumed to be true without question, and which does not require proof. It is also known as a postulate (as in the parallel postulate). The axiom is to be used as the premise or starting point for further reasoning or arguments, usually in logic or in mathematics. This means it cannot be proved within the discussion of a problem. So inside some discussion, it is thought to be true. There are many reasons why it has no proof. For example, # The statement might be obvious.
Set: , in 1894. Cantor was the first mathematician to talk about sets]] A set is an idea from mathematics. A set has members (also called elements). A set is defined by its members, so any two sets with the same members are the same (i.e., if set \mathit{X} and set \mathit{Y} have the same members, then \mathit{X} = \mathit{Y}).

Constipation: Constipation is when it is very hard to pass stool (defecate): that is, get rid of digested food waste (feces). Constipation can be caused by many things. One is eating or drinking too much dairy products that use cow milk. To solve this problem many people use a laxative or eat defecation-inducing foods such as plums. Another possible cause could be an obstruction somewhere along the digestive tract (the path that food travels inside the body). A person suffers from constipation if he or she passes stool three times in a week or more seldom.
Kernel (computer science): A kernel is the central part of an operating system. It manages the operations of the computer and the hardware, most notably memory and CPU time. Kernels also provide services which programs can use through system calls. There are five types of kernels: * A micro kernel - A kernel which only contains the basic functionality; * A monolithic kernel - A kernel which contains many device drivers. The Linux kernel is an example of a monolithic kernel. *Hybrid Kernel - The Microsoft Windows NT kernel is an example of a hybrid kernel.

It has about 7,000 students. The world's highest church tower is the Ulm Minster in Ulm. It is tall. Also, Ulm has the oldest city theatre in Germany. Albert Einstein was born in Ulm.
Landlocked country: A landlocked country is country with no access to any oceans or seas. As an example, Austria is landlocked. France is not landlocked because it has access to the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean. A sea is also landlocked if does not have access to an ocean. This is also called an endorheic basin. As an example, the Caspian Sea is landlocked. The Gulf of Mexico is not landlocked because it has access to the Atlantic Ocean. If a country is landlocked by landlocked countries (surrounded by landlocked countries), then it is doubly landlocked.
Kyrgyzstan: Kyrgyzstan, officially the Kyrgyz Republic, is a country in Central Asia. The country is landlocked (has no coast) and mountainous. It has borders with China, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Its capital is Bishkek. It was a socialist republic of the Soviet Union, but became independent in 1991.

Many ISPs have their own portals, but there are many other portals by other companies, like Microsoft's MSN, Ask.com, and Yahoo!.
Humanism: Humanism is a philosophy or a way of thinking about the world. Humanism is a set of ethics or ideas about how people should live and act. People who hold this set of ethics are called humanists. Humanists prefer critical thinking and evidence (rationalism and empiricism) over acceptance of dogma or superstition. In modern times, humanism is close to secularism. It refers to a non-theistic approach to life, looking to science instead of religious dogma in order to understand the world. The term was made widely known by scientists in the mid-20th century.
The Guardian: The Guardian is a British newspaper. It is published every day, except on Sunday. The Guardian is edited by Katharine Viner.
Algae: Algae (singular: alga, plural: algae) are plant-like living things. They make food from sunlight by photosynthesis. The study of algae is called phycology or algology. The term covers different groups, and they are not all closely related. They are a polyphyletic group. The term lumps together different kinds of organisms. They are very ancient, and existed long before other types of plants. They date back to the Mesoproterozoic, over a thousand million years ago. They are not quite the first type of life, because they all seem to use plastids which originate in cyanobacteria.
Alga (Korday district): Alga (; ) is a hamlet in the Korday District of Kazakhstan. It is one of several communities in Kazakhstan with this name. The A-2 highway from Bishkek to Almaty runs through the town. A significant architectural feature is its mosque. in Kazakhstan
Kelp forest: Kelp forests are a type of marine ecosystem that is present around colonies of kelp; they contain rich biodiversity. Kelp can stretch 2-30 meters or more (up to 60 m in Macrocystis pyrifera) from their anchors on the sea floor to the surface. It provides a vertical infrastructure that is home to many fish and invertebrate species. Kelp forests also often attract mammalian visitors, including whales, sea lions, sea otters, and SCUBA-diving humans. Kelp forests draw their name from an analogy to forests on land.
Symbiosis: digs burrow, goby fish keeps lookout]] Symbiosis (pl. symbioses) means living together. It describes close and long-term relationships between different species. The term was used by Anton de Bary in 1869, as "the living together of unlike organisms". A symbiont is an organism living in a relationship with another species in which one or both get benefits. When one species lives inside another species, or a microscopic symbiont lives inside the cells of a host, it is called an endosymbiont. The relevance of symbiosis is its frequency and its evolutionary significance.
Al Ain: Al Ain (Arabic: العين) is a city in the United Arab Emirates. The city name just means "the spring" or "the eye" in Arabic. This name come from the water sources in the area. The city is in the emirate of Abu Dhabi, right next to the border with Oman. It is often called the 'Garden City of the Persian Gulf' because of the many parks, tree-lined avenues and decorative roundabouts within the city. Al Ain, Abu Dhabi and Dubai form a kind of geographic triangle in the center of the country. Each city is around 150 kilometers from the other two.

There is no separate name for the Danish portion of the peninsula, so it is simply called the same name.
Plebiscite: , by the Irish government, in 2009.]] A plebiscite or referendum is a type of voting, or of proposing laws. Some definitions of 'plebiscite' suggest that it is a type of vote to change the constitution or government of a country. Others define it as the opposite. Australia defines 'referendum' as a vote to change the constitution and 'plebiscite' as a vote that does not affect the constitution. There are two types of result * Mandatory - meaning the government must do what the result says * Advisory - meaning the result of the vote is only to help the government make the final choice.

Exclave: .]] An exclave is strip of land that belongs to an entity (like a country or a region) but that is not connected to it by land (islands are not counted). The strip of land is surrounded by other political entities. A good example is Kaliningrad Oblast (the region around the Russian city Kaliningrad). It belongs to the Russian Federation, but is separated from the rest of that country by territory belonging to Lithuania and Poland. Although both meanings are close, an exclave might not be an enclave.
Enclave: .]] In general use, an enclave can be any special area of a bigger area of land, such as a part of a city that has different taxes than the rest of the city. In political geography, an enclave is a piece of land which has a different country totally around it. If another country has sovereignty over it, it is also called an exclave of that other country. It is usually landlocked, meaning it is completely encased by the surrounding country Exclaves can also exist within a country. This is when some administrative regions have holes (of other such regions) in them.
Panhandle: of Oklahoma, with its panhandle marked in red]] A panhandle is a word used in geography to mean a narrow strip of land that is surrounded on all sides, except one, by one or more countries or regions. The strip of land is connected to the country or region it belongs to on one side only. This looks like the handle of a frying pan. Panhandles include: *Florida Panhandle *Oklahoma Panhandle *Alaska Panhandle is the state's southeast
New town: , the capital city of Brazil, is a planned city]] A new town, planned community, or planned city is a kind of city that is designed by architects and engineers before it is built. Most cities and towns just develop over the years, without a clear plan, and urban planning is used only for later expansion. Planned communities are designed with separate districts of the city for parks, stores, homes, and offices. Many planned communities have a transportation system for commuters. There are many examples of capital cities being planned throughout history like Baghdad, Iraq; Washington D.
Park: A park is an open place in a city or town for nature. There are often trees, benches, statues, and ponds in a park. Some parks built in big cities are very large. These can have fountains or picnic areas. A park is an open area,often found with trees,benches,statues,etc. There is also lots of nature around, such as flowers, animals, trees, and much more. It is mostly used for recreational activities such as walking, exercising, cycling, playing,etc. A play park can even have swings,slides and some adventurous activities.
Pond: A pond is a body of water smaller than a lake. Ponds support a wide range of wildlife: ducks, turtles, swans, small fish, and frogs can live in a pond. Usually, in most ponds sunlight can reach to bottom. In some cases, ponds do not last all year round. This type of pond is called a vernal pond, or ephemeral, seasonal, or temporary wetlands. These types of ponds do not have any fish. Some ponds are now getting polluted because of humans. Unlike rivers, lakes stay in one place. They do not flow from one place to another.
Swan: A swan (Cygnini) is a kind of water bird, from the genera Cygnus and Coscoroba. They are in the subfamily Anserinae, in the family Anatidae, which also includes geese and ducks. Many swans live in colder places, such as northern Europe, Asia and North America. They live on water. They swim on top of the water and eat plants off the bottom of ponds, lakes, or oceans. They also eat insects and other small animals. A baby swan is called a cygnet. Swans are tough, strong birds who will stand no nonsense from dogs or cats.
Pupa: ) becoming a pupa. Time: Nine minutes]] A pupa (plural: pupae or pupas) is part of becoming an adult for some insects, like some butterflies, moths, beetles, flies, and bees. The pupal stage comes after being a larva; the next stage is adulthood. The pupa stage of a butterfly, called a chrysalis (plural "chrysalids"), is a well-known example of a pupa because they are often found in the open. The pupa stage of a moth, such as the silkworm, is called a cocoon. biology

This name was ranked #257 on the US Popular Names in 2021.
Goose: ]] Goose (plural geese, family Anatidae) are birds. There are three species groups of geese: the genus Anser, the genus Branta, and the genus Chen (biology) This family also includes the [[swans, which are mostly larger than geese, and the ducks, which are smaller and have short necks. Geese are famously gregarious: they like to stick together. They can be moved in large herds because of this feature of their behaviour. Both as chicks and as adults, geese show collective animal behaviour. Geese migrate in groups in the spring and fall, flying together in a V-shape.
Ovary: Ovaries (singular: Ovary) are organs found in female organisms. Ovaries are part of the reproductive system needed to reproduce sexually. Most vertebrate animals have two ovaries. Birds usually have only one working ovary; snakes have one ovary in front of the other. The ovaries are similar to testicles in male organisms.
Axe: An axe (or ax) is an ancient tool. It is used to shape, split and cut wood. The hand axe was probably the first tool in the Stone Age. It did not have a handle. In the past, axes were used as weapons by soldiers. Today, axes are usually related to woodcutters and firemen. Axes are simple machines. They are in the category of wedges. They are usually made of some sort of metal, mainly steel or iron. They can have a metal or wooden handle. tools tools
Rhinoceros: A rhinoceros (rhino for short) is any animal in the family Rhinocerotidae. They are in the order Perissodactyla, or odd-toed ungulates. There are five living species. Two of these species are native to Africa. Three of these species are also native to Southern parts of Asia.
Alcoholic proof: Alcoholic proof is a measure of how much ethanol there is in an alcoholic drink. It is commonly used the world over, on the basis that 100 degrees proof is the equivalent of 50 % alcohol by volume (ABV or Alc/Vol). In the United States, it is double the percentage of ABV. A hydrometer can be used to measure the precise proof of a spirit. This test has gone through many formal changes. A "proven" solution was defined as 100 degrees proof (100°). People have found out that this takes 57.15% ethanol.
Acetobacter: Acetobacter is a kind of bacteria. These bacteria are known by their ability to change alcohol to acetic acid in the presence of air. There are several species within this genus, and there are other bacteria that can form acetic acid under different conditions; but all of the Acetobacter are known by this ability.
Archbishop of Canterbury: The Archbishop of Canterbury is the spiritual leader of the Church of England and in the Anglican Communion the leader of its mother church. They are the head of the Church, and live in the English city of Canterbury. The Archbishop is chosen by the English monarch (the church's "supreme governor"), under guidance from senior bishops, acting in cooperation with the prime minister of the UK. The office has been vacant since 7 January 2025 following the resignation of Justin Welby, the [[List of Archbishops of Canterbury
Ethanol: of Ethanol]] Ethanol, also known as ethyl alcohol, grain alcohol or just alcohol, is a flammable, colorless chemical compound whose chemical formula is C2H5OH, also written as C2H6O. It is the active part of alcoholic drinks, which are drunk in most cultures worldwide. Ethanol is also used as a solvent because it can dissolve many other chemicals and is not very toxic. Yeast makes most of the ethanol that people use.
Boiling point: ]] The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the substance boils, or enters a state of rapid evaporation. For pure water this is 100° Celsius or 212° Fahrenheit, at standard pressure. Standard pressure is 1.0 Atmosphere (unit). Boiling points can be changed in several ways. The addition of solutes or other substances usually changes the boiling point. Additionally, changing the pressure on a liquid changes its boiling point. The boiling point of a liquid depends on the pressure of the surrounding air.
Platonic solid: &nbsp; File:Tetrahedron.svg|Tetrahedron File:Hexahedron.svg|Cube File:Octahedron.svg|Octahedron File:POV-Ray-Dodecahedron.svg|Dodecahedron File:Icosahedron.svg|Icosahedron A Platonic solid is a kind of polyhedron (a three-dimensional shape). It has the following traits: * Each of their faces is built from the same type of polygons. * All the edges are the same, and all of them join two faces at the same angle. * There are the same polygons meeting at every corner of the shape. * The shape is convex, meaning the faces do not go through each other (intersecting), or span the same range (coplanar).
Euclidean algorithm: The Euclidean algorithm is an algorithm. It can be used to find the biggest number that divides two other numbers (the greatest common divisor of two numbers).
Eukaryote: An eukaryote is an organism with complex cells, or a single cell with complex structures. In these cells the genetic material is organized in the cell nucleus. Animals, plants, algae and fungi are all eukaryotes. There are also eukaryotes amongst single-celled protists. In contrast, simpler organisms, such as bacteria and archaea, do not have nuclei and other complex cell structures. Such organisms are called prokaryotes. Eukaryotes evolved in the Proterozoic eon. The oldest known eukaryote is Grypania, a coiled, unbranched filament up to 30&nbsp;mm long.
Unicellular organism: , a kind of alga, is among the largest unicellular species. Its diameter can reach .]] Unicellular organisms are organisms that have one cell. They are divided into two quite different types, from different classification kingdoms. *The prokaryotes, bacteria and archaea, have cells with no nucleus and a simple cell structure. *Eukaryotes have a nucleus, and a more complex cell structure. The differences between the prokaryota and eukaryota are significant. Eukaryotes possess a nucleus and various subcellular organs called organelles, and prokaryotes do not.
Multicellular organism: has been treated to show the nuclei of its cells.]] Multi-cellular organisms are organisms with more than one cell. This is the case for animals, plants and most fungi. In such organisms, cells are usually specialised. All the cells with the same function work together. Such a group of cells is then called a tissue. Multi-cellular organisms have a set of cells that specialize in reproduction. Reproduction in such organisms is usually sexual, but for some, asexual reproduction is usual. The sex cells are either sperm or ovum (also named "egg") cells.
Hexahedron: A hexahedron (plural: hexahedra) is any polyhedron with six faces. A cube, for example, is a regular hexahedron with all its faces square, and three squares around each vertex. There are seven topologically distinct convex hexahedra, one of which exists in two mirror image forms. (Two polyhedra are "topologically distinct" if they have intrinsically different arrangements of faces and vertices, such that it is impossible to distort one into the other simply by changing the lengths of edges or the angles between edges or faces.
Kazan State University: Kazan (Volga region) Federal University (, Kazanskiy (Privolzhskiy) federalnyy universitet; ) is a university in Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia. It was founded in 1804. The famous Russian mathematician Lobachevsky was its headmaster from 1827 till 1846. The post is now being held by Myakzyum Salakhov (Mäğzüm Säläxev). Kazan University is also known as "the birthplace of organic chemistry" because of the works of Aleksandr Butlerov, Vladimir Markovnikov, Aleksandr Arbuzov, and others.

It can also refer to certain Atlantic and Pacific islands (like Bermuda) and sometimes Oceania. The name started in the early 16th century, shortly after America was colonized. The people of the European Middle Ages thought the world was only Africa, Asia, and Europe. These continents are called the Old World. The Americas were also referred to as the "fourth part of the world".
Rabbit: Rabbits or bunnies are mammals of the order Lagomorpha. There are about fifty different species of rabbits and hares. The families and eat vegetables and hay. In the wild, rabbits live in burrows, that they dig themselves. A group of rabbits living together in a burrow is called a warren. Rabbits are famous for hopping and eating carrots. A male rabbit is called a buck, and a female is called a doe. A baby rabbit is called a kit, which is short for kitten. Rabbits have a gestation period of around 31 days.
Louis Pasteur: Louis Pasteur (December 27, 1822 – September 28, 1895) was a French microbiologist and chemist. He and his wife, Marie, are best known for their experiments supporting the germ theory of disease, and he is also known for his vaccinations, most notably the first vaccine against rabies and anthrax.
Akrotiri and Dhekelia: Akrotiri and Dhekelia are two British overseas territories that border the Republic of Cyprus. They are used as military bases by the United Kingdom. The bases were kept by the United Kingdom after Cyprus changed from being a colony in the British Empire, to being an independent republic. The United Kingdom kept them because of the important location of Cyprus in the Mediterranean Sea.

Flatulence: Flatulence (commonly known as Farting or passing gas) is when gas leaves the anus. This sometimes happens with a sound that can be embarrassing to some people, but in some cultures it is treated like humor. The word flatulence comes from the Latin word flatus, which means blowing or breath, but people today usually call it farting. Children normally pass gas 30 times a day as their digestive system is not fully developed. Adults on the other hand only let wind approximately 15 times a day. In mammals like humans, the gases come from two sources: swallowed air (for example, while eating, talking or drinking) and gases naturally created by bacteria in the body during digestion.
Computability theory: Computability theory is part of computer science. Scientists want to know what can be computed, and what can not. There is a model of a computer that is used for this. It is called the Turing machine. A Turing machine basically is a special typewriter with an endless ribbon. The machine is named after the mathematician Alan Turing. A problem is computable if it can be expressed in such a way that a Turing machine can solve it. One of the best known examples is the Halting problem. The task is to write a program which says for all programs whether they will finally stop.
Batman (city): Batman is a city in southeast Turkey. It is the capital (city) of the province with the same name. In 2010, 325,000 people lived there. There are many Kurds in that area. The area has much oil and gas. There is a railway track at Kurtalan, near this city. The track runs all the way to Istanbul. There is also an airport near Batman. The name is short for the Bati Raman mountains.
Typewriter: A typewriter is a machine that is for typing on a piece of paper instead of writing by hand. It has keys for typing letters, numbers, and symbols one at a time. Typewriters were created in 1829. Typewriters were originally invented to make writing faster and printing. The earliest typing was done on stone, clay, or metal sheets by inscribing them. A typewriter does not have computer memory. As with writing with a pen, it is difficult to correct mistakes. One advantage is that many of them are not electrical, so you do not need to plug them in.
Nocturnal animals: s are nocturnal.]] s are crepuscular or nocturnal.]] s are mostly nocturnal.]] Nocturnal (Latin: nox - night, darkness) animals are animals which are mainly active during the night. They hunt or feed during the night, and sleep during the day. Diurnal animals do it the other way around. Crepuscular animals are mostly active near dawn, dusk, and sometimes when the full moon throws light. Domestic cats hunt mice and voles mostly at this time. Cathemeral animals are equally likely to be awake and active at any time of day or night.
Censorship: , a listing of books the Catholic Church banned, published in the 17th century]] Censorship is when an authority (such as a government or religion) or other group cuts out or suppresses communication. This has been done widely. All countries, religions and societies have their limits as to what can be said, or written or communication by art or nowadays by computer. Certain facts are changed or removed on purpose. This may be done because it is considered wrong, harmful, sensitive, or inconvenient to the government or other authority.

Volleyball: Volleyball is a team sport. The teams are separated by a large net. It has six players on each side of the net. Each team is allowed twelve substitution players. The game starts when the captain from each team decides which side of the court they will play on, by the toss of a coin, which also determines who will serve (hit) the ball first. The point of the game is to keep the ball in the air. The ball can be played with any part of the body, with a maximum of three strokes a team. If at any point the ball hits the floor, the side that the ball landed on it is a point for the other team.
Twilight: Twilight means either dawn (in the late postmidnight or early morning) or dusk (in the late afternoon or early evening). In the morning, dawn is when it is not dark any more, and the light of the sun is just starting to appear, before sunrise. In the evening, it is the other way around and that phenomenon is called dusk. At sunset, the sun disappears, and darkness is settling in. Light fades away. The following have been defined: *Civil twilight is when the sun is less than 6° below the horizon. It ends at sunrise in the morning or follows sunset in the evening.
Dusk: Dusk occurs at the darkest stage of twilight, or at the very end of astronomical twilight after sunset and just before nightfall. At predusk, during early to intermediate stages of twilight, there is enough light in the sky under clear conditions to read outdoors without artificial illumination; however, at the end of civil twilight (when Earth rotates to a point at which the center of the Sun's disk is 6° below the local horizon), lighting is required to read outside. of a day
Great Depression: 's Migrant Mother shows poor children in California with their 32-year-old mother, Florence Owens Thompson. She said "that they had been living on frozen vegetables , and birds that the children killed. She had just sold the tires from her car to buy food. There she sat in with her her, and seemed to know that my pictures might help her, and so she helped me.]] The Great Depression was the global economic crisis that started after the U.S. stock market crash in 1929.

However, in object-oriented programming, computer programs use objects that talk to one another to change the data in those objects and to work in a way that the user wants. Because of the way object-oriented programming is designed, it helps the developer by allowing for code to be easily reused by other parts of the program or even by other people.
